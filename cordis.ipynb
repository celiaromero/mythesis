On one hand, personalisation is a great opportunity to provide the final clients with the cloths they desire, but on the other luxury fashion houses are facing the increasing need of having some automated solutions that will help them in creating 'customized product' in a faster lead time. In fact all fashion houses manufacturing menswear are focused on providing Made to Measure products to their customers, because it increases their revenues, but at the same time this also increases their costs.  An integrated and automated management of the whole value chain will decrease the lead time, increase customization application and decrease costs.\\nCrea Solution Srl proposes the TailorFit solution that will dramatically accelerate the timing of the whole process, by managing every step of the cloths manufacturing: 1) Acquisition of body measures and selection of the type of clothing, collected in a store anywhere in the world or online, 2) Outfit design: data are sent to an intelligent CAD-based system that will generate the optimal person-tailored outfit design starting from the chosen cloths model, 3) Outfit manufacturing: a software will identify the optimized fabric cut according to the tissue and its physical characteristics (i.e. the deformation of the fabric) and then will cut it rapidly allowing time and fabric savings. \\nTailorFit solution is innovative compared to existing ones as those do not provide the management of the entire process, but rather they separate it into parts, do not allow customers to have an integration with the web, do not handle the perfect cut of fabrics and cutting times are operational only for striped fabrics and paintings.\\n'\",\n",

It will adopt participatory action research with public and private actors and stakeholders to better understand the range of policy and practical challenges in different case study contexts (localities, sectors, management systems, etc.). \\n\\nAn EU-level spatially explicit assessment of causalities between socio-political and institutional drivers, different land management systems and multiple delivery of PG will be complemented by fine-grained analysis within the case studies, and comparative meta-analysis will be applied to develop an operational framework for mapping, valorising and determining what PG and ecosystem service (ES) provision is needed and feasible within particular territories and sectors. New data-sets, transferable methods and tools that are fit-for-purpose and sensitive to the plurality of decision-making contexts will be generated. By improving recognition of the social and economic value of PG, PEGASUS will promote improved and innovative approaches to their provision by businesses and communities, and highlight specific policy improvements. It will provide specific advances in CAP, forestry and other relevant policies, underpinned by strong scientific evidence.\",\n",
       " 'According to the Global Market Forecast, there is a strong need to ramp up the productivity in the aeronautic industry and to this aim, all manufacturers are highly investing in flexible and lean manufacturing to reduce cost and boost productivity. Robotics is a key technology enabler but its adoption in the aeronautic industry is only at an early stage due to a number of barriers related to strict product requirements. Current commercial robotized assembly cells of airframe parts usually resort to high payload robots.  The LABOR project has the challenging objective to overcome some of the barriers mentioned above in the automation of many critical assembly sub-operations, as drilling, inspection, sealing and fastening, by proposing a novel lean approach. The overall technological strategy consists in the adoption of small-scale robots (with the aim of saving costs and gaining flexibility) in conjunction with smart fixtures and external axes to increase their workspace. Furthermore, still in view of cost savings and the possibility to have spare parts at disposal with a very limited investment, the robotic work cell will make use of standard process tools, such as electrical drilling tools or automated fastening tools, suitable adapted to be integrated into a robot end effector compatible with quick tool-changers. Vision system will used in order to adjust the coordinates where the robot has to drill based on real time scanning of the sub-components and to check the quality of the holes to guarantee a high standard of the process. Each components of the self adaptive robotic cell will be considered as a Cyber Physical System and a distributed intelligence approach will be adopted. The consortium has experience in the proposed approach for the aeronautic sector and has the needed competences to bring the proposed concepts in the real environment and to exploit the results of the project.',\n",
       " 'In the aerospace industry very high quality standards have to be met. For the manufacturing of carbon fibre parts this is currently solved through extended end-of-line inspection in combination with re-work processes to deal with defective parts. Also, in-situ visual inspection is used for quality control, which is currently causing huge productivity losses (30%-50%) during lay-up and has become a real bottleneck in carbon fibre parts manufacturing.\\n\\nThe project will provide a solution by developing inline quality control methods for the key process steps: automatic lay-up (dry fibre placement and automatic dry material placement) and curing. At the system level decision support systems will be developed that assist human decision-making when assessing defects and when planning the part flow through the production line. These will be supported by simulation tools for part verification and logistical planning. \\nThe future manufacturing of the A320neo wing covers will be provide the background for the developments. Each such wing cover consists of two parts, that each cost several hundred thousand Euros in manufacturing. Assuming the planned production rates of 60 planes per month from 2025, savings of 150 MEUR in production costs can be obtained per year.\\n\\nThe consortium consists of all key players that will play a future role in the manufacturing of such large carbon fibre parts. Airbus with its research centers Airbus Group Innovations and FIDAMC will play a leading role in the consortium as far as the multi-stage manufacturing process is concerned. Machine builders (MTorres, Danobat) and research centers will develop the inline quality control, while Dassault Systémes will provide simulation support.',\n",
       " 'Large areas of agricultural land in W. and N. Africa are heavily degraded, with water scarcity, low soil fertility and poor plant health, due to use of unsuitable agronomic systems and inappropriate management. In W. Africa, poor water, organic matter and nutrient retention limit food productivity, whilst in N. Africa, salinisation, wind erosion, formation of crusts and compaction threaten rainfed cropland and silvopasture. The low food productivity, poor resilience and unsustainability of current approaches have severe socioeconomic and environmental consequences. The overall goal of SustInAfrica is to empower smallholder farmers, small and medium enterprises and various government and non-governmental organisations in Ghana, Burkina Faso, Niger, Egypt and Tunisia to successfully intensify food production and deliver ecosystem services in a sustainable and resilient manner. This will be achieved through: A) comprehensive analysis of i) local/regional target ecosystems; ii) currently applied and potential landscape, soil, water and plant health management strategies and agronomic systems; iii) relevant actors across supply/value chains; iv) business models and policies; v) challenges and threats to production; B) development of technologies, including a smart platform supporting farmers in decision-making, concerning factors assessed in A); C) implementation of field trials at target sites, combining traditional knowledge, sustainable strategies and systems (agroecology, agroforestry, organic farming) and modern technologies (developed apps/platform); D) communication/dissemination/education/training to inform stakeholders/consumers and empower smallholders (especially women/youths); E) exploiting/continuing approaches/technologies for improved productivity/ecosystem services, long-term self-sufficiency beyond the project, reduced hunger/poverty and gender/wealth disparity, reduced environmental impact, long-term local food sectors growth/increased economic benefit.',\n",
       " 'The vision of IASIS is to turn the wave of data heading our way into actionable knowledge for decision makers. This will be achieved by integrating data from disparate sources, including genomics, electronic health records and bibliography, and applying advanced analytics methods to discover useful patterns. Big Data in healthcare is in its early days, and most of the potential for value creation is being unclaimed.  One of the main challenges is the analysis of acquired data. While information is becoming ever easier to obtain, the infrastructure to collect, integrate, share, and mine the data remains lacking. These data are an invaluable resource for deriving insights to improve decision and policy making. The goal is to turn these large amounts of data into actionable information to authorities for planning public health activities and policies. The integration and analysis of these heterogeneous sources of information will enable the best decisions to be made, allowing for diagnosis and treatment to be personalised to each individual. IASIS aims to pave the way towards comprehensive access to data from disparate sources and the results of analysis, in the form of actionable knowledge for policy-making. The project will offer a common representation schema for the heterogeneous data sources. The infrastructure will be able to convert clinical notes  into usable data, combine them with genomic data, related bibliography, image data and more, and create a global knowledge base. This will facilitate the use of intelligent methods in order to discover useful patterns across different resources. Using semantic integration of data will give the opportunity to generate information that is rich, auditable and reliable. This information can be used to provide better care, reduce errors and create more confidence in sharing data, thus providing more insights and opportunities. Data resources for two different disease categories will be explored, dementia and lung cancer.',\n",
       " 'By using metamaterials and metasurfaces as the platform, this proposal focuses on the novel topological physics and applications introduced by Berry phase. The flexibility in engineering the artificial ‘atoms’ and ‘molecules’ of metamaterials provides unlimited possibilities to create new structural effect where symmetry (or symmetry breaking) and topology play critical roles. We are particularly interested in the role Berry phase plays in various nontrivial surface optical effects, including topological surface states and spin Hall effect of light. The investigation of the scattering immune surface states in a topological metamaterial, i.e. an effective medium approach, acts to unify the spin Hall effect of light with the more unconventional scheme of topological orders and protected surface states. We will further exploit Berry phase in the nonlinear regime, in particular harmonic generations, to control the nonlinear coefficients to an unprecedented level. Hence our study on Berry phase in the nonlinear regime will point to a new research direction on nonlinearity coefficient engineering, which will have important impact in the area of nonlinear optics. The proposal also investigates into practical applications brought by a novel type of geometrical metasurfaces, where the phase and hence the wavefront are finely controlled by the Berry phase in a highly robust manner. The proposal involves the development of innovative synthesis technologies, theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, experimental characterizations, and device development. The new symmetry and topological effects in this research will greatly impact a number of disciplines including material science, condensed matter physics and photonics.',\n",

Today, satellites provide close to full Earth coverage and produce a significant amount of data that needs to be downlinked to Earth for processing. The downlink constraints combined with the constantly growing productivity of missions require faster data handling, processing and transfer. Present processing solutions show constraints regarding computational performance. Size and transfer speeds of on-board storage/mass memory limited downlink/transmission capabilities. Furthermore, existing toolchains are not able to support recent evolving technologies.   S4Pro will design and implement enabling technology for high-end data products produced on-board spacecraft through the implementation of a power efficient high performance space processing chain designed for low-Earth orbit (LEO) missions with a focus on Earth observation and satellite communication systems. This implementation will be achieved through consequent optimisation of the payload data management system accompanied by use of COTS components, as well as by the miniaturisation of high-performance hardware. S4Pro will combine state-of-the-art industrial computing technologies (COTS), equipped with advanced and scalable processing capabilities, and space qualified BSOTA computing platforms in order to optimise the data processing chain and support the next generation of data intensive missions, such as high data rate SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical applications as well as powerful regenerative communication processors in SATCOM applications.',\n",
       " 'Light carbon structures are increasingly used in modern aircrafts for reducing weight and thus fuel consumption. The carbon materials are more sensitive to overheating than metals. Hot air ducts are used to conduct air heated by engine exhaust to the cabin heating system. At several locations, those hot air ducts are installed within or in close proximity to the carbon structures. Therefore, reliable and precise hot air leak detection is an essential safety feature of modern aircrafts. The proposed activity aims at developing an innovative, powerful and reliable fibre-optic technology for an aircraft hot air leak detection system and validating it in a representative aircraft environment.\\nState-of-the-art electrical hot air leak detection systems detect and localize leaks in aircraft hot air ducts by analyzing electric shortcuts. However, the response of such systems just indicates that the critical temperature is exceeded. It is impossible to vary the threshold setting along the cable and false alarms due to stray signals are common. Localization of leaks is difficult and the sensor cables are irreversibly damaged by exceeding the critical temperature.\\nBased on our deep understanding of using fibre-optic sensing systems in harsh and safety-critical environments, LIOS will select the optimum fibre-optic technology for hot air leak detection in aircrafts, which overcomes the limitations of the electrical systems, complies with the requirements of the tender and fulfils the other essential requirements of aircraft applications. LIOS will demonstrate the technology’s capabilities, using a proof-of-concept system in the LIOS laboratories. After testing, we will re-design the demonstrator to enable a demonstration within an aircraft environment, allowing to pass the respective environmental tests and to fulfil the requested TRL of 6. The re-designed demonstrator will be installed at the facilities of the topic manager and tested in collaboration with the topic manager.',\n",

The use of wood or other energy crops especially the utilization of biomass residues is at the center of research because of the large application potential in the manufacturing of CO2-neutral biomass fuels. So, this proposal relates to the topic SIE 1 – 2014/2015.\\nThe H.J.X.W. Holding GmbH, a medium-sized Munich based company, developed the innovative treatment process “florafuel” to convert wet biomass streams into high-grade biomass fuel pellets or briquettes. The positive impact on the fuel quality is the reduction of the water content and of harmful substances such as chlorine and potassium in the biomass fractions. Moreover, mineral particles such as stones, sand, soil and metals are removed during the process which has been realized during the national project “RESPEL” into a prototype and shown very promising results. Several biomass streams such as grass and foliage have been successfully converted into fuels with a heating value of ca. 18 MJ/kg and all other properties require from the DIN EN 1496-6 in a cost-effective process. The Technology Readiness Level of the developed innovative treatment plant is assigned to level 6. Potential customers are users with organic residues up to 20,000 tons per year, like farmers, composting and biogas plant operators and municipalities. \\nIn project phase 1 a feasibility study will reveal the technical feasibility and the optimal way to reduce the manufacturing costs fostering its market uptake and show how the improved plant can be technically and economically marketable. A business plan will be developed for an optimal commercialization. These two deliverables will serve as a basis for the construction of an improved plant and its commercialization which will be conducted in project phase 2.',\n",

       " 'The gastrointestinal tract is colonized by a community of microbes, the microbiota, which has a significant impact on human health and nutrition. The mucus gel layer structure provides the barrier between the microbiota and the intestine preventing the occurrence of the inflammation process. Indeed, an altered microbiota (towards mucus degrading bacteria) and defects in the mucus structure have been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis.\\nUnderstanding how members of the microbiota can alter mucin composition, can, potentially, be deployed to ensure that the structure of this ecosystem maximizes human health. This approach, however, is limited by a lack of understanding how mucins are metabolized by the microbiota. Significantly, available genomic/metagenomics sequence data of the microbiota presents an exciting, but so far, unfulfilled, opportunity to make decisive advances in our understanding of mucin degradation by members of this ecosystem. In this project I will seek to combine this genomic information with in vivo studies to understand the mechanisms of mucin utilization by the human microbiota and the impact on UC development. The data from the research programme will underpin the development of future therapeutic strategies to improve human health.\\nThe fellow is Portuguese and is now completing her PhD at the Newcastle University, UK. The fellow has experience in enzyme activity screening, enzymatic characterization and structural biology. In this fellowship she will have the opportunity to develop skills in genetic manipulation of anaerobic bacteria, microbiota in vivo (mouse) studies and structural analysis of O-glycans. This fellowship will enable the fellow develop her current skill set to include methodologies and approaches so that the molecular analysis of the target enzymes can be placed within a biological context.',\n",
       " \"Pesticides constitute priority pollutants for natural resources. Microbes, mostly in the form of microbial consortia are pivotal in the in situ pesticide biodegradation. EMIGRATE aims to investigate the complex interactions driving the coherence and biodegradation capacity of natural bacterial consortia, and through this, enable the production of biotechnological and bioengineering tools for novel environmental clean-up strategies. A microbial consortium degrading the fungicide thiabendazole used in fruit-packaging plants will be used as a model. This choice is based on the high biotechnological potential of this consortium considering the environmental risk associated with the use pattern, recalcitrance and toxicity of this fungicide and the complete lack of information regarding its microbial metabolism. Through its innovative research EMIGRATE will facilitate the re-integration of the fellow to the local and EU research community. Project's objectives will be achieved through 7 work-packages: WP1 will deal with project management, IPR and results exploitation, WP2 will focus on fellow's training and WP3 on the dissemination and public engagement of project's findings. WP4 will focus on the in-depth phylogenetic characterization of the bacterial consortium and the identification of the roles of consortium members on pesticide metabolism (Stable Isotope Probing - amplicon sequencing). WP5 will assign wider functional roles to consortium members, identify key catabolic genes and elucidate the metabolic pathway of the fungicide via a meta-genomics, -transcriptomics, -metabolomics approach. Finally, WP6 and WP7 will exploit the bacterial consortium for isolation of novel enzymes-biocatalysts and the development of an innovative biological process for the depuration of the relevant agro-industrial effluents. Secondments to academic and industrial partners will be carried out for skill development of the fellow on isotopic techniques, metabolomics and bioengineering.\",\n",
       " 'Approximately 45-60% of all cancer patients are treated with radiotherapy. Some of these patients have a good outcome, but in other cases their illness fails to be cured. This may result from distant metastases or from regrowth of the primary tumor. This training network is built on the premise that considerable advances in understanding radiobiology will open novel routes for effective therapeutic intervention with biological targets to improve the outcome of cancer treatment; this progress requires a European-wide effort. \\nThis network of radiobiologists, clinicians and scientists with complementary expertise will stimulate outstanding science, meeting the high demand for excellent young academics enhancing Europe´s competitive capability in this highly relevant but underrepresented and fragmented research area. We will strengthen collaborations and technological platforms to develop effective therapeutic strategies for cancer. The failure to eliminate the primary cancer can be placed into 2 categories: the radioresistance of the tumor and the sensitivity of surrounding normal tissue; and the effects of the tumor microenvironment leading to greater overall resistance and altering the immune response to the tumor. This will be combined with translational work designed to identify and implement new therapeutic strategies for use in radiotherapy. Students will benefit from the expertise of the whole, both academic and industrial including unique research technologies that will now be available throughout the network, including a variety of screening platforms, methodology for preclinical cancer therapy and novel radiation and imaging technologies. The European community will benefit from the pursuit of innovative hypotheses, training of new researchers, and dissemination of knowledge. By combating a major death-related disease in Europe this project will raise health and bring long-term benefit to the European and international community.',\n",
       " \"A period is a complex number defined by the integral of an algebraic differential form over a region defined by polynomial inequalities. Examples include: algebraic numbers, elliptic integrals, and Feynman integrals in high-energy physics. Many problems in mathematics can be cast as a statement involving periods. A deep idea, based on Grothendieck's philosophy of motives, is that there should be a Galois theory of periods, generalising classical Galois theory for algebraic numbers. This reposes on inaccessible conjectures in transcendence theory, but these can be circumvented in many important cases using an elementary notion of motivic periods. This allows one to set up a working Galois theory of periods in many  situations of arithmetic and physical interest.\\n\\nThese ideas grew out of the PI's recent proof of the Deligne-Ihara conjecture, in which the Galois theory of multiple zeta values  was worked out. Multiple zeta values are one of the most fundamental families of periods, and  their Galois group plays an important role in mathematics: it is conjecturally equal to  Drinfeld's Grothendieck-Teichmuller group, the stable derivation algebra on moduli spaces of curves, and the Galois group of mixed Tate motives over the integers. It occurs in deformation quantization, the homology of the graph complex, and the Kashiwara-Vergne problem, as well as having numerous connections to string theory, and quantum field theory.\\n\\nThe goal of this proposal is to generalise this picture.  Periods of moduli spaces of curves, multiple L-functions of modular forms, and Feynman amplitudes in quantum field and string theory should each have their own Galois theory\\nwhich is yet to be worked out. \\n\\nThis is completely uncharted territory, and will have numerous applications to number theory, algebraic geometry and physics.\",\n",
       " 'The European energy market is rapidly changing under the influence of three megatrends that currently drive the transformation of energy sectors worldwide: decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. These megatrends have stimulated several technical and social innovations in the energy sector, which offer alternatives to the traditional business model of large centralized energy utilities and have the potential to further the goals of the Energy Union. One such example of social innovation in the energy sector are new forms of local energy communities that generate, store and use energy in a collaborative way and hence allow consumers to get involved in the production and storage of energy (“prosumage”) at the local level. New clean energy communities in a changing European energy system (NEWCOMERS) are often democratic and participatory in nature and at the same time characterized by unconventional alliances of actors, the use of innovative and smart technologies and new forms of value creation for their members and society. The NEWCOMERS project aims to investigate which regulatory, institutional and social conditions, at the national and local level, are favorable for the emergence and operation of  new clean energy communities. Furthermore, NEWCOMERS will explore how these new clean energy communities meet their members’(i.e. citizens’ and consumers’) needs better than more traditional energy services business models and whether they have the potential to increase the affordability of energy, their members’ energy literacy and efficiency in the use of energy, as well as their members’ and society’s support for the clean energy transition. The ultimate goal of the NEWCOMERS project is to identify the types of clean energy communities that perform best along a variety of dimensions, such as resilience, citizen engagement, security, efficiency and affordability, while being based on sustainable business models that have the potential to be scaled-up.',\n",

The overarching aim is to uncover and analyse the dynamic cultural politics of hip-hop music and community on the Internet, with three specific objectives: to design and apply a groundbreaking web-oriented, two-part methodology of data-driven and case-study research into online cultural networks; to apply musical, thematic, and political/feminist/critical race analysis to digital data objects (music, video, text) as expressions of hip-hop culture, politics, and aesthetics; and to generate conclusions on European priorities concerning online cultural expression, engagement, and education for sharing with policymakers. Among hip-hop's vast international listener base are many young and/or marginalised individuals, with unanswered questions about safety and security, communal opportunities, and wellbeing benefits of interaction with hip-hop's diverse and dynamic cultural expressions online. DIGITAL-FLOWS pioneers new approaches to these questions, generating high-impact outputs for academic and target audiences and policy recommendations concerning Internet use, education, and integration. The project will set a new benchmark in interdisciplinary studies of digital-native culture and provide a transferable model for web-oriented studies of popular culture more broadly.

       " 'Baltic Sea communities faced intense pressures from the 12th to 13th century AD, including colonization, forced conversions, and environmental change. The social resiliency of these communities in response to this crucial inflection point remains controversial. Did the external pressures catalyse the formation of a regional pan-Baltic identity? Or did splintered, hyper-local responses intensify differences between communities? The clearest measure of these seismic social shifts is how religious and mortuary behaviour changed in response, as communities create and negotiate a shared identity through the performance of ritual. The BONEZ project integrates multi-proxy osteological methods to investigate funerary and non-funerary ritual deposition of animals at five cemetery sites in Poland, Lithuania, and Kaliningrad before, during, and after colonization (1st to 13th AD). By combining long-established osteological methods with cutting-edge, high-resolution histological, isotope, and proteomic analyses, BONEZ reconstructs where, how, why, and with whom animals were treated and deposited in pre-Christian cemeteries. BONEZ will be the first study to unite the study of Baltic ritual activity with broader academic discussions of pre-Christian religion through rigorous scientific analysis of underutilized bone assemblages. This research has the potential to transform our perception of shifting tribal affinities using changes in ritual practice as an index of social resiliency. The first-of-its-kind integration of these methodologies as well as the regional and temporal scale of the analysis make BONEZ highly innovative and a key case study in the comparative osteology of complex skeletal assemblages. This research will have significant legacy benefits for the broader anthropological community as a state-of-the-art methodological blueprint for multi-proxy research on complex ritual deposits as an index of social resiliency transferable to any geographic or temporal context.',\n",
       " 'Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical in the treatment of all diseases. Researchers are constantly discovering new links between specific biomolecules and diseases, often uncovering ‘panels’ of markers with high sensitivity and specificity for disease diagnostics. However, our current diagnostic tools are unable to take advantage of these panels as they lack sensitivity, or are too costly and slow for practical application. Accordingly, new technologies that can help transform these fundamental discoveries into revolutionary clinical tools are in high demand. These must be rapid, efficient, robust and cost-effective. To this end, I will develop a new rapid diagnostic assay that combines the unique functional properties of fluorescent nanomaterials and enzymes. The core technology is an advanced nanoparticle-biomolecule construct consisting of highly fluorescent ‘quantum dot’ inorganic nanoparticles coated with DNA. These nanobioconjugates (termed ‘AmpiDots’) act simultaneously as both templates for isothermal amplification of target miRNAs and as highly sensitive fluorescent sensors. The result will be a rapid, highly sensitive, versatile and efficient assay that can detect multiple targets simultaneously and give a robust signal for assay readout. A critical aspect of the work will be the use of advanced microfluidic-based analytical systems to optimise the assay and to study the unique phenomena that arise when enzymes interact with nanoparticles.',\n",
       " 'My proposal aims to take advantage of my ground-breaking finding that it is possible to mature, or activate, the [FeFe] hydrogenase enzyme (HydA) using synthetic mimics of its catalytic [2Fe] cofactor. (Berggren et al, Nature, 2013) We will now explore the chemistry and (bio-)technological potential of the enzyme using an interdisciplinary approach ranging from in vivo biochemical studies all the way to synthetic model chemistry. Hydrogenases catalyse the interconversion between protons and H2 with remarkable efficiency. Consequently, they are intensively studied as alternatives to Pt-catalysts for these reactions, and are arguably of high (bio-) technological importance in the light of a future “hydrogen society”.\\nThe project involves the preparation of novel “artificial” hydrogenases with the primary aim of designing spectroscopic model systems via modification(s) of the organometallic [2Fe] subsite. In parallel we will prepare in vitro loaded forms of the maturase HydF and study its interaction with apo-HydA in order to further elucidate the maturation process of HydA. Moreover we will develop the techniques necessary for in vivo application of the artificial activation concept, thereby paving the way for a multitude of studies including the reactivity of artificial hydrogenases inside a living cell, but also e.g. gain-of-function studies in combination with metabolomics and proteomics. Inspired by our work on the artificial maturation system we will also draw from our knowledge of Nature’s [FeS] cluster proteins in order to prepare a novel class of “miniaturized hydrogenases” combining synthetic [4Fe4S] binding oligopeptides with [2Fe] cofactor model compounds. \\nOur interdisciplinary approach is particularly appealing as it not only provides further insight into hydrogenase chemistry and the maturation of metalloproteins, but also involves the development of novel tools and concepts applicable to the wider field of bioinorganic chemistry.',\n",
       " 'This proposal aims to shed light on the life strategy of Mycena (or bonnet mushrooms), a widespread group of macrofungi and with important functions in forests and other terrestrial ecosystems. While its members have traditionally been uniformly assumed to be degraders of litter, wood and other dead biological matter, very recent research has suggested that several members could in fact be parasitically or mutualistically biotrophic with plants. In numerous studies, environmental sequences with affinity to Mycena have been observed associated with plant roots. To solve this puzzle, we will use a multifaceted, interdisciplinary approach where we combine traditional knowledge about fungal cultivation with advanced DNA sequencing technology and isotope analyses techniques. The rapidly developing high throughput DNA sequencing technology (HTS) produces millions of DNA strands within hours, and by applying this to plant roots, we will quickly obtain an overview of the presence of Mycena in or on plant roots (indicating a possible biotrophic relationship). We will create a database of Mycena sequences from our own sequencing as well as sequences already publicly available. By sequencing the entire genome of five carefully selected species of Mycena, we will be able to analyse the genomic content associated with different life strategies. As molecular identification of Mycena associated with plant roots does not indicate an ecological interaction per se, we will employ innovative research techniques designed to quantify potential interactions. Isotopic fractionation of carbon/nitrogen of Mycenas and plants at field sites can reveal the mushroom´s source of carbon, and co-culturing of biotrophic Mycenas together with plants will provide direct evidence for the nature of their relationship(s). This research will clarify the ecology of a prominent and widespread genus of fungi, thereby illuminating its role in forest and general plant ecology.',\n",

For this study, 2 research groups with solid and complementary expertise and skills are required: The French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (France) and the University of Groningen (The Netherlands). The methodology implemented in this project will be: (i) characterization of proteins secretion pathways in Sodalis for heterologous expression of peptides, (ii) identification of promoters overexpressed in Sodalis upon interaction with Trypanosoma, and their characterization by fusion to fluorescent proteins, iii) paratransgenesis assays in flies and evaluation of the in vivo activity in infected and non-infected flies, stability across time and inherency to progeny, iv) analysis of the vector competence, using the new expression system by the production of antimicrobial peptides active against Trypanosoma, production of insecticidal peptides to kill the flies infected and RNA interference with the fly/symbionts.

Thus, they may control general protein translation by regulating the level and function of ribosomes. It is currently thought that understanding the process of snoRNP biogenesis will provide the knowledge indispensable to determine their exact function and means of regulation. Although, it is known that SUMO-mediated protein modifications are crucial for snoRNP functions, the E3 responsible for this process as well as their precise targets, or time and space frame of the modification are not known. Preliminary results of the host group obtained by novel proteomic approaches demonstrated that proteins of box C/D snoRNP complex undergo SUMOylation and that BCD1/ZNHIT6 might be a new SUMO E3 ligase responsible for these modifications.\\nThe specific aim of this study is to demonstrate whether ZNHIT6 indeed is a SUMO E3 ligase, to identify its substrates and reveal the function of BCD1-mediated SUMOylation of these targets in the regulation of RNA metabolism. For that purpose, I will be trained in a number of state-of the-art techniques. Notably, I will create a series of cell lines depleted of BCD1 or expressing its tagged versions using CRISPR/Cas technology. The role of ZNHIT6 in RNA metabolism will be analysed by classical biological methods, such as: IF, WB, FACS. In addition, I will use new mass spectrometry based approach designed by the host lab for the detection of SUMOylated targets. A wide range of in vitro assays will also be used to determine interactions and SUMO E3 ligase activity of ZNHIT6. The innovative character of this proposal lies in the complementarity of research techniques used and the participants involved for studying this biological question and will provide insights into the cross talk between SUMOylation and RNA metabolism.',\n",

This crisis is vastly concentrated in developing countries, which host 85% of the world’s displaced population. Nevertheless, we still know relatively little about the economic consequences of forced migration in these countries. \\nFORCEDMIGDEV seeks to fill this gap. It is organised in complementary parts that analyse the two dimensions of forced migration – internal displacement and international migration (refugees) – which constitute very different economic phenomena. The first part develops a structural model to analyse the long-run impacts of refugee inflows in developing countries. The model is estimated and used to investigate the effects of the Syrian refugees in Turkey, the largest host country in the world. I am able to answer questions that are relevant for developing but also developed host countries. What are the distributional effects of refugee shocks? What are the welfare effects across regions? What are the effects of providing refugees with a legal status? \\nThe second part combines reduced-form and structural methods to investigate the effects of severe climate shocks on internal displacement and its impacts on economic development. I take advantage of unique data availability in Brazil to estimate the reduced-form effects of internal displacement on a broad array of outcomes at destination. I then move to develop a novel quantitative spatial model that captures the equilibrium effects in origin and destination regions, while accounting for congestion and agglomeration externalities and labour market frictions. I estimate the model and use it to assess the long-run, micro and macro effects of internal displacement in Brazil. This part lies on the under-explored intersection of climate and development economics, which has a large potential to open new avenues for future research.',\n",

It has been demonstrated that lemon juice, due to its low pH (pH≈2.3), inhibited key digestive enzymes thereby interrupting gastric digestion of starch in vitro. This effect can significantly reduce the glycemic response in humans. In particular, adding lemon juice to a starch rich meal reduced the mean blood glucose concentration peak by 30%. Considering the panoply of food options available, it is likely that other combinations have similar effects but no work has been conducted to develop a consolidated knowledge base to exploit this strategy.  \\nGlucoMatchMaker will go beyond the state-of-the art by addressing this knowledge gap.

SAPIENS will train the first generation of SPP experts sharing a common understanding of the challenges faced in achieving the SDGs. The PhD interdisciplinary research will focus on 15 innovative SPP topics articulated along three axes: (a) SPP from the international agenda to actual buying practices (actors, sustainable economics, new approaches to public buying), (b) procurement to achieve the SDGs (incl. human, workers, women rights, different environmental concerns, SMEs), and (c) sector-specific applied SPP (construction, textiles and catering). \\nRelevance: Target 12.7 of the SDGs specifically focuses on promoting “public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities” but SPP is relevant for and may contribute to the achievement of most SDGs.

Until very recently, the development of most conventional monitoring, forecasting and prediction tools has been based on the assumption of stationary environmental systems. In the context of global change these tools are increasingly pushed towards and even beyond their design limits (the latter resulting in the first line from the prevailing limitations in spatial and temporal resolution of environmental observations).\\n\\nFor this project, we propose a rationale stating that only novel, high-frequency/high-resolution environmental monitoring and predictive modelling will yield new process understanding of ecosystem functioning. Technological progress offers as many opportunities as it triggers challenges: what is needed now are new strategies to generate, manage and analyse BIG DATA at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Innovation can only stand as a synonym for ‘significant positive changes’ if [a] we manage to clearly state the challenges (global change & non-stationarity) and problems (generating and managing high-frequency information) and [b] transform them into solutions, i.e. the quantification and prediction of environmental responses to global change as a prerequisite for designing and implementing adaptation and/or mitigation strategies wherever needed.\\n\\nThe timely outcomes of this research project will hence be of great relevance for the scientific community, regulatory agencies, and the private sector.',\n",

The invisibility of these waters, however, poses formidable challenges for those who rely on them: locating, measuring and controlling aquifers is complex and precarious, yet of utmost importance for human survival in many parts of the world. The overall aim of the proposed project is to explore the vital connections between humans and aquifers in everyday life. Building on trans-disciplinary studies that consider water as the contested nexus of social and political affairs, this project explores groundwater as both mediating and generating diverse ‘groundwater practices’: as an invisible resource, groundwater requires visualization; as an underground supply, it calls for innovative extractive techniques; as a finite good, groundwater needs to be regulated and controlled; and as a practical everyday resource, it sustains irrigation, sanitation, and human consumption. Through ethnographic fieldwork in Atacama Desert of Northern Chile, this project will develop an analytical framework to understand how social relations are affected by various groundwater practices. The proposed research will explore such practices with a focus on the effects that the visualization of aquifers has on socio-economic and eco-political inequalities. Through transdisciplinary training at the Universidad Católica del Norte, I will strengthen methodological skills to study the groundwater practices of indigenous communities, hydro-geologists and state administrators. I will transfer the acquired skills to the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, where I will strengthen understandings of the dynamics among groundwater practices, power, and culture, providing trans-disciplinary input for policymakers engaged in the design and realization of the Sustainable Development Goals.

It operates electronic structures of dimensionally paradoxical 2D semiconductors and spatially limited nD (n=0-2) guests, directs charge migration processes, mass-produces advanced catalysts and elucidates time-evolved catalysis. Synergic impacts crossing 2D-nD will lead to > 95%/hour rates for pollutant removal and >20% quantum efficiencies for H2 evolution under visible light.

At the same time atmospheric CO2 is a cheap and readily available carbon source that can in principle be used for the synthesis of biomass/biofuels and value-added products. However, as synthetic chemistry lacks suitable catalysts to functionalize the CO2-molecule, there is an increasing need to exploit the CO2-fixing mechanisms offered by Nature for applications at the interface of chemistry and biology. This proposal is centered on reductive carboxylation, a completely novel principle of enzymatic CO2-fixation that we discovered only recently and that is one of the most efficient CO2-fixation reactions described in biology so far. First, we will focus on understanding the novel principle of reductive carboxylation, by studying its catalysis at molecular scale and single step resolution. This will allow us to derive the first detailed catalytic framework for highly efficient CO2-fixation and enable us to engineer novel carboxylation reactions and products. Second, we will establish a new in vitro platform for the assembly and optimization of artificial ('synthetic') CO2-fixation pathways that are based on reductive carboxylation and that have been calculated to be kinetically and bioenergetically favored compared with naturally existing CO2-fixation pathways. This platform closes a long-standing gap between the theory and practice of synthetic pathway design, and will be used to develop the first functional in vitro module for CO2-fixation, a 'synthetic organelle'. Finally, we will realize synthetic CO2-fixation in selected biological model systems. To that end, we will implement the optimized in vitro pathways in isolated chloroplasts, as well as alpha-proteobacterial hosts to create novel CO2-fixing organelles and organisms, breaking new grounds in understanding and engineering biological systems for efficient CO2-fixation.'\",\n",

New groundbreaking services often require different transport protocols, better signalling between application and network, or a more flexible choice of links. A few large enterprises have the resources to support their innovations by developing their own transport systems—Adobe, Google and Microsoft have done so. Open sophisticated transport protocols exist now, but are difficult for SMEs to use owing to their lack of support across the Internet.\\n\\nNEAT addresses two obstacles to Internet innovation: 1) It lowers the barrier to service innovation by developing a free open-source transport system that will allow SMEs to leverage the rich set of available transport protocols. 2) It paves the way for an architectural change of the Internet where new transport layer services can seamlessly be integrated and quickly made available, minimising deployment difficulties, and allowing Internet innovators to take advantage of them wherever possible.\\n\\nBy optionally signalling between applications and the network, NEAT demonstrates new avenues for in-network support of application services.

       " 'Physical barriers of the body and their immunological dysregulation are connected to a variety of inflammatory diseases and therefore an emerging area of interest in medicine. The gut and its microbiome gained center stage, whereas the skin as large primary immunological barrier to the environment is still less appreciated. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a prototypic inflammatory disease which usually starts with skin lesions, before spreading to the musculoskeletal regions. To date, it is still obscure why the inflammatory process in some patients with psoriasis is restrained to the skin, whereas in other patients it extends to tendons and joints. Moreover, disease spreading to the joints associates with local tissue remodelling as evidenced by new bone formation at the insertion site of tendons into the bones. The molecular and cellular regulation of this “skin-joint axis” leading to development of PsA is still unclear but essential to understand organ communication in inflammatory diseases, the identification of potential biomarkers for early recognition of the disease and the development of preventive treatments. We will take advantage of a new model resembling PsA, which was established in our lab, with the aim of (1) studying disease spreading from the skin to musculoskeletal regions, (2) deciphering the molecular mechanisms that lead to uncontrolled local tissue remodeling, and finally (3) testing a new translational approach to prevent spreading of inflammation and tissue remodelling. We plan to adopt cutting-edge techniques to achieve our goals, which in turn will contribute to a better knowledge of the connection between epithelial surfaces and inflammation.',\n",

       " 'The media framing of politics significantly shapes the features of political modernity. This discursive mediatization signifies a cultural shift in modern politics and is often driven by political preferences, as well as economic policies that underline media action. In such conditions, news coverage often tends towards a more cynical representation of politics, and the public becomes more alienated from political processes and the media. Scholars term this the “spiral of cynicism,” or, in the context of EU news, a “spiral of Euroscepticism” (Galpin & Trenz, 2016, 2). The latter is reflected in the ongoing shift from “permissive consensus” to “constraining dissensus” (Hooghe and Marks, 2008) in public support of European integration. Media framing of the European project thus plays a crucial role in constructing citizens’ perceptions of the EU and European identity and attitudes towards EU enlargement.\\n\\nThe MEDIATIZED EU project aims to study how the media discourses are constructed to foster or hamper the European project and how they resonate among the public by focusing on the elite-media-public triangle.

It seeks to examine the ways in which ideals and markers of social class are transmitted, negotiated and performed within a unique setting – that of a rock music school in the US Midwest. By examining a traditionally white working-class and often patriarchal musical genre within a decidedly middle-class context – a private school, whose costs and institutional structure present a barrier to access for lower-income students – it seeks to shine a light on the shifting production of class within a region whose working-class-ness has at times been considered both problematic and emblematic of conflicted class, race and gender relations in the post-industrial United States.\\n\\nThis research understands music education and performance as a unique site of the construction and negotiation of class consciousness and identities. It will consider how class-coded meanings and narratives are attached to visual and sonic symbols within rock education and performance. These symbols include musical instruments, sounds, language, gestures and ideals of musicianship and performance. It will examine how these symbols are transmitted, embodied and performed within the context of the school’s rehearsals, lessons and showcase performances, with a particular eye to the role of the gendered body in processes of teaching, learning, listening and music-making. This project takes a unique and innovative approach, marrying anthropological and ethnomusicological methods and modes of investigation with theoretical and analytical perspectives from cultural sociology and gesture studies, drawing as well on existing knowledge and research within music education, sociology of music and the emerging field of popular music education, in order to inform a truly interdisciplinary interrogation of social class and music education in the twenty-first century American Midwest.',\n",

In order to provide relevant test data to guide the TVF aerodynamic design, it is critical that engine-relevant TVF inlet and exit flow conditions are provided.\\nTherefore the main objective of this project is to execute a rig test programme for TVF aerodynamic designs, coupled with an upstream HPT stage and downstream LPT blade, in a flow environment representative of future geared civil turbofan aero-engine applications. Since the performance of any HPT-LPT transition duct is impacted by the level of the incoming flow effects, a variation of HPT tip gap and purge flow levels is planned. The aerodynamic performance of the TVF is also affected by the downstream LPT rotor.

PAD is a chronic condition generated by the narrowing of arteries, which reduces the normal blood flow and triggers a wide range of manifestations mostly in the lower limbs, from chronic pain to critical limb ischemia. PAD’s progression can lead to chronic wounds, gangrene, amputation, and in most severe cases, death.

Applied to the patient’s ear, AuriMod sends specific electrical stimulation to the auricular branches of the vagus nerve, delivering a patient-tailored therapy that will improve the quality of life of PAD patients. This Phase 1 project will mainly focus on planning further product development, verifying the current supply chain, evaluating the business model and commercialisation plan.

Cryptology is one of the affected disciplines. Indeed, the current state-of-the-art asymmetric cryptography would become insecure, and we are actively searching for alternatives. Symmetric cryptography, essential for enabling secure communications, seems much less affected at first sight: its biggest known threat is Grover’s algorithm, which allows exhaustive key searches in the square root of the normal complexity. Thus, so far, it is believed that doubling key lengths suffices to maintain an equivalent security in the post-quantum world.\\nThe security of symmetric cryptography is completely based on cryptanalysis: we only gain confidence in the security of a symmetric primitive through extensive and continuous scrutiny. It is therefore not possible to determine whether a symmetric primitive might be secure or not in a post-quantum world without first understanding how a quantum adversary could attack it. Correctly evaluating the security of symmetric primitives in the post-quantum world cannot be done without a corresponding cryptanalysis toolbox, which neither exists nor has ever been studied. This is the big gap I have identified and that I plan to fill with this project.\\nNext, doubling the key length is not a trivial task and needs to be carefully studied. My ultimate aim is to propose efficient solutions secure in the post-quantum world with the help of our previously obtained quantum symmetric cryptanalysis toolbox. This will help prevent the chaos that big quantum computers would generate: being ready in advance will definitely save a great amount of time and money, while protecting our current and future communications.\\nThe main challenge of QUASYModo is to redesign symmetric cryptography for the post-quantum world.',\n",

The research on satellite QKD has mainly focused on discrete variable (DV) protocols, which are less sensitive to channel transmission but require single photon detection technology. Continuous variable (CV) protocols, on the other hand, are based on standard telecom detection technology, which is much faster and more efficient. Recently, CV protocols have shown to work well in high losses fiber-based environments.

       " 'MitO2Health aims to develop and empirically prove a radically new pathophysiological model of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a systemic energy deficiency disease. Traditionally, MDD is conceptualized as a neurotransmitter deficiency in the brain. However, with pioneering methods my group has provided evi-dence for reduced mitochondrial energy production in MDD, characterizing it as a cellular-metabolic disorder with a lowered production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Reduced mitochondrial bioenergy production and impairments in oxygen (O2) homeostasis (reduced levels of erythrocytes, less hemoglobin and its lower O2-binding affinity due to oxidative stress), as well as oxidative stress and inflammation (the “MitO2Health parameters”) were consistently associated with an increased risk for MDD, but have been neglected so far in MDD research and therapy. In MitO2Health we will more comprehensively than ever before investigate the physiological mechanisms underlying MDD and will provide first longitudinal evidence on the mutual in-terplay between the MitO2Health parameters and MDD. Moreover, we will apply cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as randomized treatment condition to test whether CBT-related MDD symptom reduction is coupled to a normalization of the MitO2Health parameters. We will treat 100 MDD patients with 6 months of CBT and compare them to 100 MDD patients of a waiting-list group and 100 healthy controls. Clinical and biological status will be assessed at four points over 18 months. We will thus characterize the biomarker pro-files of MDD treatment response and resistance as well as MDD symptom recurrence during a follow-up pe-riod. MitO2Health will not only establish a modern etiological model of MDD, but also identify biomarkers of individual therapy response and relapse. This will lead to new diagnostic standards and inspire personalized MDD treatment concepts that will fundamentally improve clinical outcomes in psychotherapy and psychiatry.',\n",
       " 'Cells are frequently exposed to stress conditions, which can disrupt cellular homeostasis and result in cell death. To minimize the damage and adapt to the stress condition, eukaryotic cells employ a highly conserved signaling pathway, the integrated stress response, which integrates a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic stress signals to reprogram mRNA translation. Consequently, translation of most mRNAs is inhibited to conserve energy, while a select group of stress-related mRNAs is preferentially translated to promote recovery and restore homeostasis. This preferential translation of stress-related mRNAs depends on special sequence elements called upstream open reading frames (uORF), but the molecular mechanisms behind this process remain largely unclear. To investigate the translational reprogramming during cellular stress, I will exploit recent advances in single-molecule imaging of mRNA translation in living human cells. \\n\\nFirst, to understand how uORFs facilitate the preferential translation of stress-related transcripts in stressed cells, I will apply single-molecule imaging of mRNA translation to measure the translational dynamics at different start codons of uORF-containing reporter mRNAs. Next, I will test how the translational reprogramming is affected by the formation of stress-inducible ribonucleoprotein granules (stress granules). To this end, I will combine the single-molecule imaging of mRNA translation with imaging and optogenetic manipulation of stress granules. Last, to complement the single-molecule imaging approach, the same reporter mRNAs will be subjected to proximity-dependent labelling assays in order to identify novel factors that facilitate stress-induced translation.\\n\\nTogether, this project will provide important insights into the regulation of mRNA translation during cellular stress. This will also expand our understanding of pathological conditions that involve misregulation of the integrated stress response.',\n",
       " 'Developing tissues have a remarkable plasticity illustrated by their capacity to regenerate and form normal organs despite strong perturbations. This requires the adjustment of single cell behaviour to their neighbours and to tissue scale parameters. The modulation of cell growth and proliferation was suggested to be driven by mechanical inputs, however the mechanisms adjusting cell death are not well known. Recently it was shown that epithelial cells could be eliminated by spontaneous live-cell delamination following an increase of cell density. Studying cell delamination in the midline region of the Drosophila pupal notum, we confirmed that local tissue crowding is necessary and sufficient to drive cell elimination and found that Caspase 3 activation precedes and is required for cell delamination. This suggested that a yet unknown pathway is responsible for crowding sensing and activation of caspase, which does not involve already known mechanical sensing pathways. Moreover, we showed that fast growing clones in the notum could induce neighbouring cell elimination through crowding-induced death. This suggested that crowding-induced death could promote tissue invasion by pretumoural cells.\\nHere we will combine genetics, quantitative live imaging, statistics, laser perturbations and modelling to study crowding-induced death in Drosophila in order to: 1) find single cell deformations responsible for caspase activation; 2) find new pathways responsible for density sensing and apoptosis induction; 3) test their contribution to adult tissue homeostasis, morphogenesis and cell elimination coordination; 4) study the role of crowding induced death during competition between different cell types and tissue invasion 5) Explore theoretically the conditions required for efficient space competition between two cell populations.\\nThis project will provide essential information for the understanding of epithelial homeostasis, mechanotransduction and tissue invasion by tumoural cells',\n",

We foresee a mathematical theory of dynamical quantum phases of matter with applications in the theory of quantum transport and nanoscale devices that manipulate heat, information, charge or magnetization. \\n\\nOur steady-state setup represents a fundamental paradigm of mathematical statistical physics which has been pioneered by the PI, who gave the first explicit solution for boundary driven/dissipative strongly interacting many-body problem (XXZ spin 1/2 chain) which answered a long debated question on strict positivity of the spin Drude weight at high temperature. \\n\\nThe main focus of OMNES will be centered on exploring the following three interconnected pathways: Most importantly, we shall develop a general framework for exact solutions of non-equilibrium integrable quantum many-body models, in particular the steady states and relaxation modes, and develop quantum integrability methods for non-equilibrium many-body density operators. Fundamentally new concepts which are expected to emerge from these studies, relevant beyond the context of boundary-driven/dissipative systems, are novel quasilocal conservation laws of the bulk Hamiltonian dynamics. Second, we shall investigate relevance of exact solutions in physics of generic systems which are small perturbations of integrable models and explore the problem of stability of local and quasilocal conserved quantities under generic integrability-breaking perturbations. Third, we shall formulate and study the problem of quantum chaos in clean lattice systems, in particular to establish a link between random matrix theory of level statistics and kinematic and dynamical features of lattice models with sufficiently strong integrability breaking.\",\n",
       " 'Neutrino Physics is one of the areas of Particle Physics with the highest potential for discoveries. DUNE, a long-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiment, will study the neutrino mass ordering and the charge-parity violation in the next decade using liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) detectors. Until DUNE begins, the only opportunity to study actual neutrino interactions in LArTPCs is the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program at Fermilab. SBND, the near detector of the SBN Program, will collect the largest statistics of neutrino interactions, enabling the resolution of anomalies which could be caused by additional neutrinos, cross-section measurements in many relevant channels for SBN and DUNE, and Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) searches. The goal of this fellowship is for Dr Crespo to make a high-visibility contribution to SBND at CIEMAT. Specifically, the objectives are 1) commission the data acquisition and trigger systems of SBND, a critical contribution to the experiment; 2) develop the simulation and reconstruction of scintillation light in the detector, which is crucial for the cosmic-ray background rejection in a near-surface experiment like SBND; 3) develop a search for BSM Heavy Neutral Leptons, which could explain the smallness of the neutrino mass, using the Fermilab neutrino beam. Dr Crespo will receive first-hand training by the CIEMAT group, which has broad experience in simulating and reconstructing scintillation light in LArTPCs, and led this work for one of the DUNE prototypes. The supervisor, Dr Gil-Botella, is the Leader of the Far Detector Dual-Phase Photon-Detection System for DUNE. Dr Crespo will strengthen the CIEMAT contribution to SBND. He is a member of SBND since 2015, and is an expert in the readout and trigger systems, and the Co-Convener of Astroparticle and Exotic Physics in MicroBooNE, another SBN experiment.

We intend to pursue three main lines of research, each of them concerning major open problems in the field.\\nI) The dynamics in a neighbourhood of the Anti-de-Sitter space with various boundary conditions.\\nThis is a fundamental open problem of mathematical physics which aims at understanding the stability or instability properties of one of the simplest solutions to the Einstein equations. On top of its intrinsic mathematical interest, this question is also at the heart of an intense research activity in the theoretical physics community.\\nII) Non-linear systems of wave and kinetic equations. We have recently found out that the so-called vector field method of Klainerman, a fundamental tool in the study of quasilinear wave equations, in fact possesses a complete analogue in the case of kinetic transport equations. This opens the way to many new directions of research, with applications to several fundamental systems of kinetic theory, such as the Einstein-Vlasov or Vlasov-Maxwell systems, and creates a link between two areas of PDEs which have typically been studied via different methods. One of our objectives is to develop other potential links, such as a general analysis of null forms for relativistic kinetic equations.\\nIII) The Einstein equations with data on a compact manifold. The long time dynamics of solutions to the Einstein equations arising from initial data given on a compact manifold is still very poorly understood. In particular, there is still no known stable asymptotic regime for the Einstein equations with data given on a simple manifold such as the torus. We intend to establish the existence of such a stable asymptotic regime.',\n",

Its relevance to high-energy and nuclear physics has grown significantly in recent years due in part to a series of algorithmic advancements.\\nThis project aims to compute time-like observables using numerical simulations of LQCD. Specifically, I will study spectral functions including the R-ratio, that is linked to the hadronic vacuum polarization of the electromagnetic current, and the hadronic tensor, that contains information on deep-inelastic scattering.\\nIt is extremely challenging to compute observables intrinsically defined in Minkowski spacetime with lattice techniques, with the main issue being that the simulated quantum field theory is defined in Euclidean spacetime. While Euclidean correlators contain all the information needed to extract real-time physics, performing the analytic continuation with finite-precision data points from numerical simulations is an ill-posed problem. A second issue is that the the computational cost is driven by the loss of the signal of hadronic correlators with Euclidean-time separation, that happens at an exponential rate.\\nI will address these issues and significantly reduce the computational effort needed thanks to algorithms advancements. I plan to solve the signal-to-noise ratio problem using and further developing multi-level Monte Carlo sampling methods, that I recently contributed to extend to theories with fermions. The resulting exponential gain in the quality of the signal is essential to be able to perform the analytic continuation, that I plan to control using state-of-the-art techniques based on the Backus-Gilbert algorithm that have recently been developed by the supervisor.',\n",

Infrastructures as detectors and computing centers are work horses but cannot operate without readout systems with high-end electronics. The goal of this project is to develop general readout electronics for cross-sectoral application. This approach overcomes the shortcoming that most experiments have to develop readout systems on their own and allows groups with little knowledge and capabilities in electronics to build world-leading experiments.

       " 'ASD is a very prevalent neurodevelopmental condition affecting more than 1% individuals, and represents a major unmet medical need since no effective treatment is available. Despite the phenotypic convergence of its core symptoms (impaired language, restriction in sociability and stereotypies, invariably coupled to anxiety and often associated to varying degrees of intellectual disability), ASD is genetically highly heterogeneous, with hundreds of bona fide causative genetic lesions. This genetic architecture breaks down ASD into a collection of rare and highly penetrant genetic syndromes, presenting key challenges but also decisive applicative opportunities: i) the accelerated regulatory path for drug approval/repurposing; and ii) the possibility that few paradigmatic syndromes may yield generalizable therapeutic inroads for ASD treatment. Duplication at 7q11.23 (7Dup), encompassing 26-28 genes, is one of best characterized ASD-causing copy number variations and offers unique translational opportunities, also because hemydeletion of the same interval causes Williams-Beuren syndrome, a condition characterized by hypersociability and language strengths, thereby providing a unique reference standard to validate treatments for the core ASD symptoms. Within my ERC-Consolidator project we successfully completed a high-throughput screening on 7q11.23 CNV patient-derived neurons and discovered that deacetylase inhibition lowers the abnormal levels of a key gene underlying the cognitive/behavioral traits of 7Dup. Having defined robust 7Dup neurodevelopmental and electrophysiological phenotypes, both in patients’ neuronal lineages and in mouse models, we now aim to generate proof of concept for the preclinical validation of selected deacetylase inhibitors in rescuing ASD phenotypes  in vitro and in vivo. For this we pursue an integrated experimental and business plan, buttressed by key industrial partnerships, to advance the most  inhibitors towards ASD treatment.',\n",

       " 'Duplication of chromosome region 7q11.23 (7Dup), comprising 26-28 genes, is one of best characterized copy number variations (CNV) causing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a very prevalent neurodevelopmental condition affecting more than 1% individuals worldwide, and for which no effective treatment is available. Despite the remarkable consistency of core ASD symptoms (impairment in language and sociability along with stereotyped behaviours), over 400 causative genetic lesions have been thus far identified for ASD, splitting it de facto into an aggregate of rare and highly penetrant genetic diseases. In turn, the convergence of symptoms grounds the hope that few paradigmatic syndromes may yield generalizable therapeutic inroads across the autistic spectrum. 7Dup is a case in point since it is symmetrically opposite to Williams Syndrome, a condition caused by 7q11.23 hemideletion and featuring symmetrically opposite phenotypes in language and sociability, thus offering unique opportunities to dissect the dosage-vulnerable circuits that affect language competence and sociability. Specifically, convergent evidence points to transcription factor GTF2I as the key gene underlying the cognitive/behavioural traits of 7Dup.  Within my ERC-Consolidator project DISEASEAVATARS we discovered that increased GTF2I dosage represses key genes involved in intellectual disability, autism and neuronal function by associating with lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1), a key chromatin modifier, and found that LSD1 inhibition rescues GTF2I-dependent alterations. Therefore, we now wish to establish in vivo proof of concept for the efficacy of novel LSD1 inhibitors in rescuing cognitive-behavioural deficits in relevant ASD mouse models recapitulating GTF2I CNV, developing an adequate business plan and industrial partnerships as prerequisites for advancing the most effective LSD1 inhibitor towards pre-clinical development for 7Dup and ASD more broadly.',\n",
       " 'As an onco-hematologist with a strong expertise in genomics, I significantly contributed to the understanding of multiple myeloma (MM) heterogeneity and its evolution over time, driven by genotypic and phenotypic features carried by different subpopulations of cells. MM is preceded by prevalent, asymptomatic stages that may evolve with variable frequency, not accurately captured by current clinical prognostic scores. Supported by preliminary data, my hypothesis is that the same heterogeneity is present early on the disease course, and identification of the biological determinants of evolution at this stage will allow better prediction of its evolutionary trajectory, if not its control. In this proposal I will therefore make a sharp change from conventional approaches and move to early stages of MM using unique retrospective sample cohorts and ambitious prospective sampling. To identify clonal MM cells in the elderly before a monoclonal gammopathy can be detected, I will collect bone marrow (BM) from hundreds of hip replacement specimens, and analyze archive peripheral blood samples of thousands of healthy individuals with years of annotated clinical follow-up. This will identify early genomic alterations that are permissive to disease initiation/evolution and may serve as biomarkers for clinical screening. Through innovative, integrated single-cell genotyping and phenotyping of hundreds of asymptomatic MMs, I will functionally dissect heterogeneity and characterize the BM microenvironment to look for determinants of disease progression. Correlation with clinical outcome and mini-invasive serial sampling of circulating cell-free DNA will identify candidate biological markers to better predict evolution. Last, aggressive modelling of candidate early lesions and modifier screens will offer a list of vulnerabilities that could be exploited for rationale therapies. These methodologies will deliver a paradigm for the use of molecularly-driven precision medicine in cancer.',\n",

       " 'Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare and devastating autosomal dominantly inherited disorder caused by the amplification of the CAG codon in the huntingtin gene. The clinical symptoms of HD are chorea and motor incoordination as well as psychiatric symptoms. To date no cure has been found to alter the progression of the striatal atrophy due to the dramatic loss of GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) which eventually leads to death. Over the past years increasing knowledge around the function of huntingtin (HTT) has allowed the identification of number pathogenic mechanisms, however the specific processes whereby the mutated HTT leads to degeneration and their temporal evolution remains unknown. We believe it is of vital importance to develop disease-relevant human cell models from clinically characterized HD subjects in which to address questions related to pathogenic mechanisms and their dependence on the CAG repeats. For this reason the aim of the proposed project is to generate induced medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) from healthy or HD-diseased fibroblasts in order to generate a reliable disease modelling tool. The applicant will optimize an existing protocol for the generation of iMSNs from direct conversion of fibroblasts published by Victor et al (2014) to obtain healthy iMSNs in the laboratory of prof.

In a second step she will perform direct in vitro reprogramming of human fibroblasts derived from well characterized patients affected with HD exhibiting different degrees of CAG repeat expansion into induced HD-derived MSNs (HD-iMSNs).

       " 'The existence of an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) remains elusive and only upper limits on its strength are known from limits on the rotation of polarization angles of radio waves. Its measurement would provide crucial information about large scale structure formation, since the IGMF is thought to act as a seed field for magnetic fields in galaxies and galaxy clusters, how the Universe evolved, and how charged cosmic rays and electromagnetic waves propagate through intergalactic space. \\nHere, I propose a new search for IGMF signatures using observations of a high-energy gamma-ray cascades from distant galaxies. Gamma rays interact with background radiation fields to produce electron-positron pairs. These pairs up-scatter cosmic-microwave photons to gamma-ray energies, initiating the cascade. The IGMF morphology is imprinted on the cascade through a deflection of the pairs in the IGMF. A novel combination of observations with imaging air Cherenkov telescopes and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, using both spectral and spatial information, combined with precise model predictions of the cascade, promise an unprecedented sensitivity for detection of the cascade signal and the IGMF. Strong constraints on the IGMF strength will be possible if no cascade is detected.\\nFurthermore, I will also search for a gamma-ray and neutrino signal from cascades initiated by cosmic rays from active galaxies. This will yield an independent probe of the IGMF and, additionally, constraints on the cosmic-ray acceleration power of such galaxies. As part of this work, I will also make predictions how the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) can further improve the detection of or constraints on the IGMF and the cosmic-ray acceleration power of active galaxies. This will result in an optimized observation strategy for the extragalactic survey and the blazar monitoring program, which are both planned with CTA.',\n",

It has been recently shown, that many of these different observational properties are deeply influenced by the evolution of the magnetic field and temperature in the neutron star interior. Our understanding of the magnetic field evolution is however still incomplete, as these 2D numerical simulations completely neglect the field evolution in the core. \\nThis project will study the magneto-thermal evolution of neutron stars with magnetic fields treading both the core and the crust, incorporating in a consistent way the effects of ambipolar diffusion and superfluidity/superconductivity. This research will explore also models where superconductivity is limited in shells, which are confined in the outer core. They are expected when the core's magnetic field is so strong, above 10^{16} Gauss, to destroy superconductivity. The magneto-thermal evolution will be studied by using 2D numerical simulations, which solve simultaneously the induction equation and the heat transfer equation. \\nThe complex magnetic field which results from the magneto-thermal evolution may describe the configuration expected in a flaring magnetar, where quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been observed. This project will study the QPOs of these complex magnetic field configurations, by using perturbation methods. We will develop a computational framework to determine the properties of seismic vibrations on magnetar's models with any magnetic field topology. \\nThe results of this research project and the combined information available from thermal history and magnetar QPOs will be used to determine, by using independent astrophysical observations and dynamical processes, the physical properties of highly magnetized neutron stars as well as to shed light into the equation of state of dense matter.\",\n",

       " 'Therapeutic drug delivery to the brain remains an unsolved challenge that limits the treatment of neurological and brain diseases, such as Glioblastoma, Parkinson and stroke. The main limitation is in the ability of the therapeutic drugs to cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). To overcome this limitation, scientists present hyperthermia as an approach to overcome this limitation. Although this approach show promising results, the studies were not focused on understanding and combining the temperature raise during the BBB opening. Thus, the possibility of using this temperature rise to both improve the BBB opening performance and to exploit it to treat brain diseases is not used. For the aforementioned to be actualized, this project will bring the latest advances in intracellular temperature and nano-thermometry to a deeper understanding of the role of temperature in the BBB opening and its possible utilization in the treatment of brain diseases, such as glioblastoma. Thus, with the effort of the host organization (world leader in develop of nanomedicine platforms) and the experienced researcher (expert in nano-thermometry), two important objectives will be achieved under this Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship: (1) detailed studies and understanding of both the intracellular temperature and extracellular temperature needed for the BBB opening and (2) design and synthesis of the nano-complex for simultaneously BBB opening and the release “in real time and on demand” of therapeutic drugs for glioblastoma treatment in vivo. The outcome of this proposal will represent an important step forward in the field of brain drug delivery, that will not only improve the applications of nanotechnology in glioblastoma treatment, but will also facilitate the overcoming of the actual limitations in the treatment of different brain diseases.',\n",

QDV technology lets researchers focus on qubit characterisation, and far less time and funding resources on constructing complex and expensive arrays of control electronics needed for qubit experimentation.\\n\\nThe main bottleneck in QC is the technology used to characterise qubits. It is not upscaling with the number of qubits that can be integrated into a processor – up to 70. A single qubit may need up to 20 signal channels. Current options offer no more than 8 channels. The extra channels add unwanted thermal and electronic noise to the experimental system which undoes qubit superpositional states.\\n\\nQDV and its QCAUX electronics address this bottleneck directly.

These temperatures are commonly achieved by using cryogenic liquefied gases (cryogens), such as liquid helium (He). However, there are a numbers of problems related to the use of these cryogens which include the oligopoly of He-3, high costs of cooling machines (€ 300-600k), and safety problems. To solve these pains, kiutra has developed a cryogen-free, continuous, and fully automatic refrigeration system based on a cryogenic magnetic cooling process known as (Continuous) Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigeration - (C)ADR. (C)ADR uses widely available and low-price cooling media, saving € 20-40k/year in comparison with typical refrigeration systems that use He-3. Moreover, the system has a complete modular and customizable design, as it can be extended with multiple units according to the cooling requirements. It also offers a wide and stable temperature range while being easy to operate and hazard-free, thanks to the elimination of cryogens. kiutra, founded in 2018 in Germany, builds easy-access turn-key refrigeration solutions. Their cooling devices combine magnetic refrigeration and closed-cycle pre-cooling to provide cryogenic temperatures without cryogens. kiutra is currently funded by “EXIST Transfer of Research”, and has raised almost € 2M to date.',\n",
       " \"'A quantum computer is a device that exploits the quantum behaviour of its constituents ('qubits') to solve a computational problem. One of the most promising 'hardware' options proposed to build such a device are point defects in solids, which hold promise of scalability and integration with current semiconductor technology. However, it remains challenging to position the point defects in a deterministic array and to integrate them into large networks. In order to address these two issues, we propose to use line defects (dislocations) as a “quantum bus” able to both create a deterministic pattern of relevant point defects and to connect them by means of localized phonons. Such idea represents a technological leap and paves the way for a quantum computer implementation that is fully defect-based, from its construction to its functioning. We remark that our proposal opens a completely new area of research, aligned with the quantum technologies flagship policy of the European commission and that will help putting Europe at the forefront of the development of quantum technologies. \\nIn order to carry out the project, it is necessary to combine the theoretical study of the stability and geometry of point and line defects with advanced electronic structure calculations of their spectroscopic properties. This is the basic strength of our proposal: it brings together the two complementary research profiles needed to carry the project. On the one hand,  Dr Barragan is an expert on the physics of dislocations and their interactions with point defects and, on the other hand, Prof Wirtz is an expert on many-body perturbation theory.       \\nIn addition, this project will open up a new research line for the Dr Barragan and will give him the opportunity to investigate problems at the interface of condensed matter/quantum technologies, increase his network of collaborations and thus serve as an important step preparing him to become an independent group leader in a European context.'\",\n",
       " \"Public key cryptography is the backbone of internet security. Yet it is very likely that within the next few decades some government or corporate entity will succeed in building a general-purpose quantum computer that is capable of breaking all of today's public key protocols. Lattice cryptography, which appears to be resilient to quantum attacks, is currently viewed as the most promising candidate to take over as the basis for cryptography in the future.  Recent theoretical breakthroughs have additionally shown that lattice cryptography may even allow for constructions of primitives with novel capabilities.  But even though the progress in this latter area has been considerable, the resulting schemes are still extremely impractical. \\n\\nThe central objective of the FELICITY project is to substantially expand the boundaries of efficient lattice-based cryptography.  This includes improving on the most crucial cryptographic protocols, some of which are already considered practical, as well as pushing towards efficiency in areas that currently seem out of reach.  The methodology that we propose to use differs from the bulk of the research being done today.   Rather than directly working on advanced primitives in which practical considerations are ignored, the focus of the project will be on finding novel ways in which to break the most fundamental barriers that are standing in the way of practicality.  For this, I believe it is productive to concentrate on building schemes that stand at the frontier of what is considered efficient -- because it is there that the most critical barriers are most apparent.  And since cryptographic techniques usually propagate themselves from simple to advanced primitives, improved solutions for the fundamental ones will eventually serve as building blocks for practical constructions of schemes having advanced capabilities.\",\n",

       " 'Sensory systems enable animals to perceive their worlds and make adaptive decisions for survival. However, finding out about the world outside is energetically expensive: it involves complex sensory systems to collect the information, and dedicated neural systems to process it. Therefore, the benefits of acquiring information need to be balanced against the costs of receiving and processing it. Consequently, evolution has equipped animals with sensory systems that fit their lifestyle and environment, to give them the information they need to enhance their survival and reproduction. However, most, if not all, animals have multiple sensory systems: how should investment in different sensory systems be balanced, and what factors affect the trade-off between investment in different sensory modalities? When environmental constraints limit the usefulness of specific sensory modalities (e.g. living in the dark), shifts in investment in different sensory modalities can occur.  What is not known is how trade-offs occur between sensory modalities that are still useful to an animal, but perhaps their relative importance changes according to lifestyle or environmental factors. This project aims to investigate the trade-off that occurs in diurnal species between the visual and olfactory systems, and explain why it occurs. I will use insects as a model system, since their neural structures, ecologies and sensory systems are well studied, and can be easily measured. I will measure the relative size of olfactory and visual systems within insect species, and test if predatory species or those that fly (i.e. species that need to rapidly assess changes in their environment) invest more in vision than olfaction. I will also test if the sizes of neural structures associated with each modality correlate with sensory ability.

Some species have evolved to store rather than consume food while availability is high, for consumption when food is scarce. This behaviour is called food hoarding and is evident in a range of taxa. Little is known about the mechanisms that underpin the motivation to hoard food. Research shows that energetically demanding conditions are linked to an increase in food hoarding. In addition, there is evidence in social species, that social rank influences hoarding behaviour. Key physiological and neurological mechanisms have also been shown to underpin an animal’s motivation to hoard food, including the stress hormone corticosterone (cort) and consumption regulating neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP). However, whether variation in cort, NPY and AgRP, or an interaction between them regulates hoarding behaviour is yet to be examined. In this project I will experimentally address these knowledge gaps using two closely related bird species that live in social groups during winter when hoarding motivation is high; the food hoarding coal tit (Periparus ater), and the non-hoarding great tit (Parus major). I will use wild-caught captive birds to; i) investigate the influence of the social environment upon hoarding and food consumption under contrasting energy budgets, ii) examine the role of cort as a mediator of hoarding motivation, iii) identify the hypothalamic regions activated during high hoarding motivation between hoarding and non-hoarding species, and iv) examine whether cort, NPY and AgRP receptor density, and NPY/AgRP expression within these regions is linked to hoarding behaviour.

First, the security of large-scale dynamically changing systems will be significantly improved. Second, we can prove properties of topologies, hosts and users who participate in transactions in one go, while keeping sensitive information confidential. Third, we can prove the integrity of graph data structures to others, while maintaining their their confidentiality. This will benefit EU governments and citizens through the increased security of critical systems.\\n\\nThe proposal pursues the main research hypothesis that usable confidentiality-preserving security assurance will trigger a paradigm shift in security and dependability. It will pursue this objective by the creation of new cryptographic techniques to certify and prove properties of graph data structures. A preliminary investigation in 2015 showed that graph signature schemes are indeed feasible. The essence of this solution can be traced back to my earlier research on highly efficient attribute encodings for anonymous credential schemes in 2008.\\n\\nHowever, the invention of graph signature schemes only clears one obstacle in a long journey to create a new generation of security assurance systems. There are still many complex obstacles, first and foremost, assuring 'soundness' in the sense that integrity proofs a verifier accepts translate to the state of the system at that time. The work program involves six WPs: 1) to develop graph signatures and new cryptographic primitives; 2) to establish cross-system soundness; 3) to handle scale and change; 4) to establish human trust and usability; 5) to create new architectures; and 6) to test prototypes in practice.'\",\n",
       " 'Contentious Rights: A Comparative Study of International Human Rights Norms and their Effects on Domestic Social Conflict \\n\\nOver the last 60 years, a broad set of international norms gained importance as instruments to regulate a globalising world. Enshrined in human rights conventions, these norms contribute to strengthen a platform for social mobilization and voice. The introduction of human rights standards at the domestic level, however, has also been responsible for the generation of new tensions on the interpretation and application of these norms. Yet, this type of conflict and polarization among social and political actors remain widely unexplored. This project will examine how ‘human rights act in practice’ in the post-ratification phase using a multidisciplinary perspective and an empirical comparative approach. More precisely, it addresses the task of identifying the conditions under which international norms generate consensus and cooperation or fragmentation and conflict between domestic social and political actors and the consequences in terms of human rights practices. The candidate fellow Dr. Lorenza Fontana will focus on a comparative analysis of two conventions (International Labor Organization’s Conventions 182 on Child Labor and 189 on Domestic Workers) in two countries (Bolivia and Philippines) and lead an interdisciplinary collaboration between Prof. Jean Grugel (University of Sheffield, SIID), and Prof. Beth Simmons (Harvard University, WCFIA). This project will greatly increase our understanding of the effects of human rights norms on domestic societies and provide policy relevant results.',\n",
       " 'As Europe enters the third decade of the 21st Century, moderation is a concept in crisis. Extremism, radicalism and ideological conflict are judged to be in the ascendant, while the moderate middle of political landscapes in a range of European countries has been physically vacated and conceptually hollowed out. This project offers a contribution to the history of moderation as an idea, as a practice, and as a virtue. Modern understandings of moderation were established in the 18th Century, through the fusing of classical and Christian concepts in a new intellectual-religious and political-economic environment. VIA MEDIA ITALICA offers an intellectual historical study of the moderate strata on the Italian peninsula in the first half of the 18th Century, the early Enlightenment. The ambition is to establish moderation as a practice and as a virtue in three different contexts: political moderation; scholarly, or epistemic, moderation; and religious moderation. Each of these contexts will be explored through a networked set of case-studies, founded upon extensive archival research, and orientated around key texts, institutions and thinkers. These three contexts will also be elaborated through a study of Lodovico Antonio Muratori as a religious, scholarly and political thinker, and reinterpreted as a theorist of moderation. This project will offer: a ‘bottom-up’ reinterpretation of the intellectual culture of the Italian peninsula between 1700 and 1750; a new reading of the contributions of L.A. Muratori to the European Enlightenment; and an interrogation of the concept of moderation as a historical and contemporary idea and practice. This project plays an essential role in the researcher’s maturation into an international, independent and interdisciplinary historian of early modern Europe. It also supports his development into a public-facing scholar, through a range of training schemes and the realisation of an extensive programme of public-orientated events.',\n",
       " 'The main objective of this project is to evaluate the validity of using temperature correction factors (e.g. Q10) to predict the rates of micropollutant biodegradation in natural communities. The Q10 correction factor is based on the Arrhenius equation, which gives degradation kinetic rate constants as a function of temperature, and it is widely adopted in modelling (such as numerical fate models) in environmental exposure assessments. Despite its popularity, the Q10 approach is still the object of great debate among scientists, as the Arrhenius relationship holds over a very small temperature range for biological systems, in which microorganisms can function, and it is based on the assumption of compositional and functional ubiquity of the microbial communities. However, a change in temperature does not only impact chemical kinetic rates, but also determines shift and adaptation of the microbial population towards degraders that survive and perform better at the altered temperature.  This project will adopt a multidisciplinary approach where biotransformation assays, kinetic modelling and high-throughput microbiological assays will be integrated to provide a thorough understanding of temperature dependence of micropollutant biotransformation kinetics in aerobic biological systems, taking into account the strong relationship between taxon traits and the environment.',\n",

This corresponds to H2020 Work Programme for 2016-2017 of reversing inequalities in Europe, and more specifically to the EU Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019.\\nApplying the theoretical framework of developmental theory, this study examines whether changes occurring in the status of women in the UK and in Israel, as part of the structural and cultural transformations that this theory points to, seep into the political discourse surrounding women and politics over time. We use the print media to analyse relevant frames on women and politics during the study period (1979-2016 in the UK and 1969-2009 in Israel - in which women were realistic candidates/elected for premiership). In addition, we utilize a quantitative content analysis of the news and commentaries in newspapers to locate interpretive references to women and politics. A sub-set of these articles is used for an in-depth qualitative analysis to draw out the key themes surround the framing of women and politics.  \\nAn important contribution of the research lies in the theoretical connection between the framing of women and politics to developmental theory's structural and cultural conditions. That is because the bulk of studies on framing gender and politics are descriptive and lack an empirically supported theoretical explanation of the changes in the framing of these issues. \\nThe findings of this research will help raising social, political and media awareness to the status of women and to women's issues in Europe, and encourage more women to take part in politics in Europe and worldwide by tackling stereotypical framing of women and politics issues and by suggesting operative steps to face backlashes to political gender equality in Western democracies.\",\n",

The project considers adaptations—particularly dramatizations—of Dickens's novels as key sites for international cultural interaction in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Adaptation to the stage transformed Dickens--Britain's emblematic national writer--into an international cultural commodity: the stage, a global network for cultural transactions, interpreted and circulated his work across Europe and the nineteenth-century colonial world. \\n\\nThe research at the heart of the “Adapting Dickens” project views adaptations as expressions of critical interpretation of literary texts as they comment upon and translate them into new media, other languages, and for consumption by a wide array of audiences. The project draws upon the latest developments in adaptation theory and pedagogy, and it seeks to find fresh venues for researching Europe’s Dickens; new tools for locating, interpreting, and disseminating work on Dickens and the nineteenth-century theatre; and ways of communicating emerging ideas about Dickens, nineteenth-century Europe, literary adaptation, and cultural currency to audiences beyond the academy. The project will (1) ensure knowledge transfer to Europe and enhance and enrich both European literary and theatre studies;, (2) enhance pedagogical innovation via public performances, classroom outreach activities, web development, and a volume on teaching through adaptation; and (3) contribute to the Fellow’s professional development through web training, advanced language study, archival research in Europe, and the production of articles and a scholarly monograph.\",\n",

Taking Francis Poulenc as an example of a French composer who experienced war twice, it looks at his creative responses to the wars. It prioritises the musical and cultural significance of localised urban, suburban and rural places in shaping a distinctive musical and national identity, an identity that was recognised by his contemporaries as representing a generation; it also scrutinises his international activities in pursuit of cultural and artistic co-operation, collaboration and exchange. The project includes a study of Poulenc’s UK connections, using understudied archival materials to explore his collaborations with composers such as Britten and Lennox Berkeley, his presence in concert life and his clandestine WWII activities with the BBC. It also examines the significance of the European-American artistic exchanges from the post-WWI period as a form of cultural co-operation and propaganda. Transnational Localism shows the extent to which creative artists reflected the trauma of conflict, contributed to peace-building and to national and European identity on a cultural level and participated in politics without needing to be explicitly politically engaged.\\n\\nMusicology was identified as an area of strategic priority by the European Science Foundation, Standing Committee for the Humanities in 2008. This project responds to this challenge by exploring the role of music in shaping identities on individual, generational, national and European levels.  It also takes the inherent interdisciplinary nature of musicology a stage further by designing a training programme and research project that is multidisciplinary with the aim of establishing research cooperation that is of mutual benefit to European and Anglophone scholarly traditions in the Humanities and Social Sciences.',\n",

Established in 1983, _The Works of Giuseppe Verdi_ (University of Chicago Press and Ricordi) aims to publish all of Verdi’s music in a critical edition, relying on the rigorous criteria developed by its Editorial Board, but the traditional printed book format of this edition presents several practical limitations for users: in particular, it does not allow for simultaneous visualisation of alternative materials and for fruition of alternative versions of the score, and it precludes addition of newly available source materials to existing volumes. \\n     DiCrEd is a multidisciplinary project aiming to address these limitations through the integration of the innovative instruments offered by digital humanities into _The Works of Giuseppe Verdi_, under the supervision of its general editor, Prof. Francesco Izzo (University of Southampton). DiCrEd employs the digital tools designed by the Edirom project (University of Paderborn) to develop 1) an applied model of digital critical edition with 2) an interactive system of fruition of the score, and 3) an applied model of digital critical edition of preparatory materials (sketches and drafts). The project uses Giuseppe Verdi’s French version of _Macbeth_ (1865) as a case study, making its full score commercially available for the first time. The project bears the potential to mark a turning point in the fields of musicology and textual criticism, with the long-term prospect of introducing digital instruments into the standard toolkit of the publishing industry related to 19th-century Italian opera.',\n",

While both fields are well studied, their interaction remains largely unexplored. This research, at the convergence of several disciplines (literature, philology, linguistics and medieval history), has a strong pioneering character. It aims at changing the perception of medieval Italian culture and interpretation of the break between medieval Culture and Humanism.\\nFor this reason, the project will develop research in varying degrees of depth. First, it will provide the first catalogue of bilingual texts and manuscripts of medieval Tuscany. Organized as a database, this tool of analysis will stir innovative research in this field, some of which will be immediately promoted during the project. \\nSecondly, two case studies, considered as important and methodologically exemplary, will be researched in detail, through the publication of two important set of texts, of secular and religious nature : 1. The vernacular translation of the Latin Epistles of Dante Alighieri; 2. A collection of polemical, historiographical, devotional and prophetical documents produced by the Tuscan dissident Franciscans in last decades of the 14th Century. \\nFinally, the entire team, led by the PI, will be involved in the preparation of a synthesis volume on Tuscan culture in the fourteenth century viewed through bilingualism, entitled Cartography of bilingual culture in Fourteenth-Century Tuscany.

The painting collection, of which a large share presumably was brought together in the first half of the eighteenth-century, consists mostly of mass-produced paintings, a novel commodity of the seventeenth century. Fascinatingly, Ledreborg Palace is not the only collection in Denmark which displays a strong emphasis on Netherlandish paintings: at least 2 other (also not disclosed) collections are known. However, the question why the Danish seem to have had a strong interest in Netherlandish paintings remains unanswered. \\nThis research will contribute to understanding the strong interest in Netherlandish paintings in Denmark during the seventeenth through eighteenth centuries by focusing on the collection of Ledreborg Palace. All the paintings will be thoroughly examined from an art historical viewpoint, however, also technical studies such as infrared and X-ray images will be carried out in order to understand also the artists working methods in their mass-production endavours to supply the entire European continent with affordable paintings. The overall result will be an improved understanding of the spread of Netherlandish art and the means by which this could be done. All the achieved data will be accessible for researchers and the public through an open-access database with 600 annotated paintings including an art historical and technical study of a carefully selected part of these hitherto undocumented and unstudied paintings. \\nSimultaneously the latest expertise in socio economic art history will be employed to situate the paintings in a European framework of the seventeenth century and their importance to the society of today. The project will provide the young professional researcher with new and essential training to become an expert in the application both technical instruments and socio-economical study of Netherlandish paintings.',\n",

Nevertheless, currently available therapies, including anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) therapy, have numerous limitations and are often associated with severe adverse effects. Therefore, the research project aims at safer and effective inflammatory bowel disease therapy by proposing development of a novel multifunctional polymeric film based platforms for oral delivery of anti-TNF-α. The drug delivery system comprises of a nanoformulation encapsulating anti-TNF-α which are then entrapped into a mucoadhesive polymeric film. These mucoadhesive polymeric films are composed of second generation highly efficient mucoadhesive S-protected thiolated polymer, which are then loaded inside pH responsive capsules for site-specific delivery. The proposed system would provide enhanced therapeutic outcome by minimizing side effect via reduction of the frequency of dosing and targeted delivery of anti-TNF-α at the site of action, which would be achieved by preventing the degradation of the encapsulated biologics, prolonging the gastrointestinal retention time of the drug delivery system, increasing drug accumulation at target site and minimizing the systemic absorption. Furthermore, additional unique benefits of the proposed systems such as the biocompatibility, biodegradability, sustained drug release at targeted site, mucus penetration of the nanoformulation, and use of accessible and patient friendly oral route, can widen its biomedical applicability and explore its use in clinics and pharmaceutical industries.',\n",
       " 'ENHANCIDO will assess the commercial and technical feasibility of novel immune tolerance-inducing small molecules as superior treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic neurodegenerative disease affecting 2.3 million people worldwide. 85% of MS cases belong to the relapsing-remitting subtype (RRMS) characterised by bouts of recurring and debilitating relapses followed by unstoppable loss of neurological functions. Unfortunately, current treatments for RRMS are ineffective, poorly tolerated, and expensive. They cannot prevent disease progression and only provide symptomatic relief. Furthermore, severe adverse effects and inconvenient administration routes contribute to high rates of treatment discontinuation amongst patients (30-80%). To tackle these issues, Prof. Ursula Grohmann has developed a set of novel, orally administered, effective, and safe small molecules that induce immune tolerance to alter the previously inexorable course of the disease. These first-in-class molecules are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the immunoregulatory enzyme IDO1. Prof. Grohmann’s PAMs increase IDO1 activity, reduce disease severity in mouse models of acute MS and show no off-target effects. Within ENHANCIDO, we will assess whether IDO1 PAMs are feasible as breakthrough treatments for RRMS. Firstly, we will validate their technical feasibility by evaluating their efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in RRMS mouse models.  Subsequently, commercial feasibility will be determined by verifying IP position and strategy, performing in-depth market and competitor analyses, and finally consolidating these into a business plan to establish the best path to commercialisation. Successful commercialisation of IDO1 PAMs could reduce the profound socioeconomic burden of MS, extend and improve the lives of patients, and provide the pharmaceutical industry with a profitable, first-in-kind drug that can potentially be used for other autoimmune diseases.',\n",
       " 'ImImmune clearance of infectious diseases requires correct T cell activation by macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that present peptides derived from ingested pathogens on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Yet, macrophages and DCs also ingest self-antigens present in healthy cells and their presentation might trigger autoimmune disease. Presentation of the minority of ingested pathogens is promoted by so-called phagosome-autonomous trafficking. Here, pathogen binding to Toll-like receptors in phagosomes triggers recruitment of proteases and transporters to these phagosomes, but not to other phagosomes present in the same cell, promoting specific presentation of pathogen-derived peptides. However, a molecular understanding of this pathogen-oriented phagosome-autonomous trafficking is lacking.\\nThe goal of this project is to determine how phagosome-autonomous pathogen recognition promotes presentation of pathogen-derived over harmless self-antigens. Based on my preliminary data and literature, I hypothesize that Toll-like receptor signaling triggers phosphorylation of multiple SNARE proteins at the phagosomal membrane. As SNARE phosphorylation can promote or prevent membrane fusion, this alters delivery of proteases and transporters to these phagosomes, which in turn promotes presentation of pathogen-derived peptides. \\nObjective 1 is to determine how SNARE function is altered upon pathogen-recognition in phagosomes using my novel quantitative Förster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FRET-FLIM)-based technique. Objective 2 is to address how Toll-like receptor-mediated SNARE phosphorylation affects phagosome-autonomous trafficking. Objective 3 is to resolve the functional roles of SNAREs in antigen presentation using a novel bio-orthogonal chemistry-based method. This study will explain the high sensitivity of the adaptive immune system for pathogens and could lead to better vaccinations and therapies for infectious diseases.',\n",
       " 'The 21st century is expected to develop towards a society depending ever and ever more on (bio-)chemical measurements of fluids and matrices that are so complex they are well beyond the current analytical capabilities. Incremental improvements can no longer satisfy the current needs of e.g. the proteomics field, requiring the separation of tens of thousands of components. The pace of progress in these fields is therefore predominantly determined by that of analytical tools, whereby liquid chromatography is the most prominent technique to separate small molecules as well as macromolecules, based on differential interaction of each analyte with support structures giving it a unique migration velocity. To improve its performance, a faster transport between these structures needs to be generated. Unfortunately the commonly pursued strategy, relying on diffusion and reducing the structure size, has come to its limits due to practical limitations related to packing and fabrication of sub-micron support structures, pressure tolerance and viscous heating.\\nA ground-breaking step to advance chromatographic performance to another level would be to accelerate mass transport in the lateral direction, beyond the rate of diffusion only. To meet this requirement, an array of microstructures and local electrodes can be defined to create lateral electroosmotic vortices in a pressure-driven column, aiming to accelerate the local mass transfer in an anisotropic fashion. The achievement of ordered arrays of vortices is intimately linked to this requirement, which is also of broader importance for mixing, anti-fouling of membrane and reactor surfaces, enhanced mass transfer in reactor channels, emulsification, etc. Understanding and implementing anisotropic vortex flows will therefore not only revolutionize analytical and preparative separation procedures, but will also be highly relevant in all flow systems that benefit from enhanced mass transfer.',\n",

There is an increasing alarm about their potential toxicological effects since most of them lack data, while others (e.g. bisphenol A) have created significant debate because of their documented endocrine properties. This project, SafePack, aims to offer a publicly usable in silico strategy to establish rapidly and cost-efficiently the level of safety concern of packaging chemicals without animal toxicity testing. There has been already initiatives to screen packaging chemicals using in silico toxicology, but all of them use qualitative approaches, mainly mutagenicity predictions, suitable for hazard identification. However they do not provide information about hazard characterization (how much is needed for triggering a toxic effect) and even less about health risks. In toxicology, 'the dose makes the poisons' and it is very important to address safety concern by balancing predicted toxicological alert with potential exposure as done in standard risk assessment. The SafePack project aims at a) fill the toxicological data gaps of large sets of packaging chemicals using computational tools to predict toxicities, b) compare predicted toxicological values with exposure to obtain Margins of Exposure (MoE), a powerful method to establish level of safety concern, c) implement the overall workflow in freely available VEGA platform to make it ready for free utilization. Thousands packaging chemicals will be compiled. A number of toxicity endpoints relevant for risk assessment will be sequentially screened using available in silico predictive models: mutagenicity, carcinogenic potency and chronic toxicity; also, endocrine activity and developmental toxicity will be covered. The quantitative predicted values will be compared to exposure estimates providing MoEs, the size of which determines the level of safety concern.'\",\n",

       " 'Hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) doubles mortality and arises due to failure of pancreatic β-cell insulin secretory function to overcome insulin resistance. Exercise reduces hyperglycaemia by improving insulin sensitivity and β-cell function; however, the variability of this beneficial effect is huge and is associated with high blood glucose and poor insulin secretion. Hyperglycaemia increases interleukin-(IL)1β levels causing β-cell death and insulin secretory dysfunction (glucotoxicity), and these phenomena are all elevated in T2D and are also augmented by IL-6, which alone is not toxic to β-cells. Interestingly, blood IL-6 levels are not only increased in T2D but are also increased following exercise due to secretion from muscle. Therefore the huge variability in the adaptation to exercise may be due to muscle IL-6-induced enhancement of IL-1β-induced β-cell dysfunction. Thus, exercise may be detrimental to T2D patients with β-cell glucotoxicity. Our objective is to determine the independent and interactive roles of IL-6 and IL-1β in the adaptations to exercise in T2D. We will achieve this by integrating the human physiology expertise of the Experienced Researcher with the transgenic mouse model expertise of the Supervisor to create a bench-to-bedside approach from which both the host institution and the experienced researcher will gain from in the future. Innovative muscle-specific IL-6 knockout mouse models and clinical anti-IL-1β drug treatment approaches will be used to ultimately increase the knowledge of how IL-6 and IL-1β interact, making it possible to optimise exercise therapy for all T2D patients, including those who would otherwise be classified as a “non-responder”.',\n",
       " 'Skin is the largest organ in the human body, forming a protective physical barrier against the outside world. Damages to skin due to physical, chemical and biological factors lead to wounds. While minor wounds heal on their own, chronic wounds (wounds that do not heal within 8 weeks), such as diabetic foot ulcers, subject the patient to significant discomfort and distress while draining the medical system of an enormous amount of resources. Wound healing is a complex, highly regulated process, and complications affect the quality of life of >4 million a year in EU (more than cancer & diabetes) that struggle to live with hard-to-heal injuries, as it can lead to infection, tissue and bone necrosis, pain and in some severe cases even amputation. Stratpharma has developed a range of primary dressings formulated as a silicone-based gel, which can be used on any wounded, damaged, compromised or diseased skin surface. This proprietary film-forming gel is also shown to be an excellent drug delivery system, using which active compounds can be delivered to the wound, thereby enhancing clinical outcomes. Using this property, Stratpharma aims to develop a breakthrough formulation, containing gel and bioglass technology, for improved chronic wound healing. During the phase 1 project, a go-to-market strategy and a supply chain will be established, as well as further development plan will be drafted. Within the overall innovation project, Stratpharma will further test and validate the new formulation, begin clinical trials, implement IP strategy and perform scaling-up activities.',\n",
       " \"The worldwide explosion of obesity has resulted in an ever-increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), a non-communicable disease that affects more than 370 million people worldwide. T2D is characterized by insulin resistance with a relative deficiency in insulin secretion. It is now recognized that there is decreased beta-cell function and mass in T2D but the precise underlying mechanism remains to be determined. Skeletal muscle accounts for >50% of the total glucose uptake in the post-prandial state, it is also the largest organ in non-obese individuals. Recent studies demonstrated that there is conversation between skeletal muscle and beta-cells, and that certain peptides (i.e. myokines) secreted by insulin-resistant skeletal muscle cells may impact negatively on beta-cell function, proliferation and survival in T2D. Nevertheless, other factors than myokines could also be involved in this inter-organ communication. A novel concept suggests microvesicles, such as exosomes, as a new cell-to-cell communication mode. The major goal of the project will be to characterize the different exosomes populations and their impact on islets cells. The findings may have important implications for understanding decreased functional beta-cell mass in diabetes, especially in T2D etiology, and therefore bring new insights into the development of innovative therapies. \\nTo achieve the aims of the innovative translational project, the candidate will be part of one of the European leader research centres on diabetes, trained to promising new research area in inter-organ communication, micro-RNA biology, as well as cutting-edge 'omic' technologies which will perfectly complement her strong knowledge in energy metabolism and physiology and create a rare expertise in candidate's profile.

A new ansatz - based on the concept of dynamical convexity - will enable to merge these two cutting-edge developments and will lead to the very first approach to Ricci flows on singular spaces. \\n\\nThe project also aims to break up the limitations for the study of (generalized) Ricci curvature for mm-spaces, until now\\nbeing restricted exclusively to spaces with uniform lower bounds for this curvature. For the first time ever, mm-spaces with\\n(signed) measure-valued lower bounds for the Ricci curvature will be studied - the absolutely continuous, non-constant case being highly innovative as well.

Indeed, although brands are of interest to us all, they remain multifaceted phenomena and defining them proves to be quite a difficult task: they are associated with entities that are not only very different to each other (e.g. an organisation, a product, a logo), but also hazy (e.g. a service, values). Whether one comes from marketing or social sciences, the quasi-ontological question of “what a brand is?” turns out to be a real intellectual challenge. Thus, drawing on and developing the theoretical and methodological apparatus of semiotics, the objective of this fellowship will be (O1) to define what a brand is semio-ontologically and what it produces semio-functionally. This involves determining how brands physically come into existence, and what they bring, in turn, to the social experience of the individuals who use them. The conclusions of my PhD thesis on the concept of “forms of life” will bring innovative hypotheses that will also enable me (O2) to create an alternative model for brand identity to those developed over the last 20 years in marketing, notably because it will place experience at the heart of all the issues. Finally, to refine the model and reveal its advantages, I will conduct a case study aimed at (O3) modelling the identity of Marca Perú, the Peruvian nation brand. By (O4) investigating the meaningful gap, that brands always raise, between promised experiences (in communication) and real-life experiences (in consumption), this case study will complete and conclude my principal objectives (O1-O2), as well as the global aim of this fellowship: to contribute to the development of the European semiotics in non-academic sectors (specifically the business one) and in other continents (mainly the American one).',\n",

       " 'Our memory system is optimised for remembering the exceptional over the mundane. We remember better those events that violate predictions generated by the prevailing context, particularly because of surprise or emotional impact. Understanding how we form and retrieve long-term memories for important or salient events is critical for combating the rapidly growing incidence of pathologies associated with memory dysfunction with huge socio-econonomic burden. Human lesion and non-invasive functional imaging data, motivated by findings from animal models, have identified subcortical structures that are critical for upregulating hippocampal function during salient event memory. However, mechanistic understanding of these processes in humans remains scarce, and requires better experimental approaches such as direct intracranial recordings from, and focal electrical stimulation of, these subcortical structures. \\nThis project will characterise human subcortico-cortical neuronal circuit dynamics associated with enhanced episodic memory for salient stimuli by studying direct recordings from human hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, ventral midbrain and cortex. Within this framework, I will elucidate the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying amygdala-hippocampal-cortical coupling that lead to better memory for emotional stimuli, extend the hippocampal role in detecting unpredicted stimuli to define its role in orchestrating cortical dynamics in unpredictable contexts, and discover the neuronal response profile of the human mesolimbic dopamine system during salient stimulus encoding. The predicted results, based on my own preliminary data, will offer several conceptual breakthroughs, particularly regarding hippocampal function and the role of dopaminergic ventral midbrain in memory.

       " 'Flow containing suspended colloidal particles is found in a multitude of situations. Unexpected particle dynamics occur in the presence of local solute concentration gradients, due to cooperating and competing effects of particle migration driven by the solute gradients and advection. This particle migration, referred to as diffusiophoresis, is often accompanied by diffusioosmosis in which the solute gradients impose slip flows over solid surfaces. Recent investigations have shown that it is possible to achieve rapid particle focusing in micro-geometries by manipulating the properties of the solute, particle and flow, as well as the surface chemistry and configuration. This can be exploited for a plethora of applications. \\n\\nMost potential applications involve flow through porous media. Approaches for modelling flow through porous media at the Darcy scale are well established today, but their extension to introduce diffusiophoretic and diffusioosmotic net effects is not straight-forward, owing to their dependence on local effects at the pore scale. The combined study of diffusiophoresis and pore-scale flow dynamics has not been attempted to date. DIPHORES aims to carry out pore-scale simulations to study the interaction of diffusiophoresis and flow through porous media.

Two novel simulation approaches are proposed to account for both stress variations and movements within the soil caused by pile installation, tunnelling and grouting: 1) a simplified formulation, with low computational costs, that combines analytical two-stage analysis methods with cavity theory and nonlinear pile-soil load transfer mechanisms; 2) the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) model to accurately model the entire soil-structure domain.

However, household size has been decreasing steadily in both developed and developing countries, at an accelerating pace, since the 1980s. The European Union (EU) leads this trend, with nearly a third of total households consisting of single residents. As a result of more people living alone with associated higher consumption, slowing population growth has resulted in neither fewer residences nor decelerating human impact on the environment. This MC-IF aims to investigate the trend toward living alone and create new knowledge about environmental impacts of different household configurations, drivers for different occupancy trends and alternative sustainable housing configurations. The research will be carried out in three phases, firstly by using existing population, housing and consumption databases; secondly be interviewing both high and low impact single resident households and finally by studying low impact household configurations in-depth. This will provide new knowledge on: how different household configurations impact sustainability; why people choose to live in different various configurations; and drivers and barriers for emerging sustainable alternatives.

       " \"This project will investigate the distribution of national income between profits and wages as proxied by the labour share in national income. The focus will be to identify the empirical regularities of factor shares in developed and emerging countries and across industries. In 1957, Kaldor established an influential stylised fact for macroeconomic modelling: the stability of the labour share. This finding, which has implications for macroeconomic dynamics, the shape of the production function and inequality, led social scientists to become 'silent' and to neglect research on labour share for many decades. Standard neoclassical growth and business cycle models, following Kaldor’s stylised fact, assume a one-to-one substitution between capital and labour. However, the recent observation of a declining labour share points to an incomplete understanding of macroeconomic dynamics and to potentially erroneous policy implications drawn from these models. This has renewed the interest of macroeconomists to unveil the sources driving this decline. The proposed study on the fluctuations of the labour share from a solid empirical standpoint will provide the broad social science academic community and the policymakers with a better understanding of the behaviour of the labour share. In particular, this project aims at (i) reconciling the existing literature on the sources of labour share decline by examining a large set of driving forces and their relationship to key macroeconomic variables; (ii) providing a descriptive analysis of labour share from a multi-sector and multi-country perspective; as well as, a decomposition of labour share into national and external factors.

The first group involves the SMEs who are the beneficiaries of “Horizon2020's SME instrument” or other EU Funded Schemes such as FETOpen, FTI but who need technical support in innovation management to enhance successful exploitation of the project and its contribution to the companies’ growth. The second group consists of SMEs with potential for international growth via product/process/service/business model innovation but who lack the knowledge, skills to manage innovation activities. Two different services will be provided throughout the project period. “Key account management” for the beneficiaries of the SME instrument will focus on identifying bottlenecks to the creation of economic impact in companies benefitting from EU\\ngrants and address these bottlenecks with the help of capable Coaches and with the aid of KAM services of EEN. “Enhancing SME innovation management capacity” for innovating SME independently from a specific project will focus on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of innovation processes in SMEs with significant innovation activities that could potentially become beneficiaries of European research and innovation supports, but not have effective access to consulting\\nservices for innovation management. As a result of the project, new types of standardised innovation support methodologies will be developed, the skills of the staff from the existing consortia will be improved, comprehensive innovation support will be given, two novel assessment\\ntools will be adapted at EU level, EEN will be embedded in Regional Innovation Ecosystem, closer cooperation will be established between key innovation support providers and relevant stakeholder\",\n",
       " 'Over the last years, women have made a significant progress in academia and science across all Europe. Yet, their representation across scientific fields and ranks remains uneven, as they are still under-represented in some STEM disciplines (science technology engineering and mathematics) and in senior positions. The WIRED project – Women In Research and higher EDucation – aims at investigating gender inequalities in academia by focusing on the reasons why and the mechanisms through which women are at disadvantage in the career progression and/or they drop-out from the academic labour market. It will undertake this challenge by means of an innovative, comparative, inter-disciplinary, multi-model and multi-level research. WIRED draws its originality from its unique data, which are the result of the combination of observational longitudinal micro-data on the Swiss and Italian academic populations with experimental data on gender discrimination in the selection processes. The observational field will be based on different administrative and web-based data sources, including the micro data on academics held by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research and by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, where the fieldwork will be undertaken. The experimental research is based on a vignette survey which will be submitted to a sample of professors in targeted Italian and Swiss Universities, chosen on the base of the results of the first part of the research. The combination of these two methods within a comparative approach will provide an extremely rich and comprehensive understanding of gender differences in academic career trajectories allowing to simultaneously shed light on the micro, meso and macro levels of explanation. Face to the scarcity of comparative and longitudinal insights, WIRED will represent a tremendous step forward in the debate on women in academia and science.',\n",
       " \"In the last years the novel, potentially revolutionary, possibilities offered by quantum mechanical systems have been deeply explored giving rise to a whole spectrum of Quantum Technologies, which are expected to have a big impact on the everyday life of future generations. Quantum metrology represents one of the most promising of these second generation quantum technologies: its aim is to exploit quantum mechanics to perform ultra-precise measurement not achievable by means of classical approaches. \\nYet, a major obstacle still stands in the way of their full exploitation: preserving quantum coherence, the necessary ingredient for quantum protocols to outperform their classical counterparts, is a very difficult task. As it happens in ``classical technologies', where the effect of noise is neutralized by monitoring and controlling the signal and its environment, quantum control is going to play a fundamental role for the development of noise-resilient protocols based on quantum mechanics.\\nThe main goal of this fellowship is to develop a more general framework for noisy quantum metrology, encompassing quantum control techniques based on time-continuous measurements and real-time feedback, and considering more general non-Markovian noisy evolutions. Beside answering fundamental questions, we will also design protocols for specific physical systems, with a particular attention for quantum opto-mechanical setups.\",\n",
       " 'Organisms of all domains of life are capable of sensing, using and responding to light. The molecular mechanisms used are diverse, but most commonly the starting event is an electronic excitation localized on a chromophoric unit bound to a protein matrix. The initial excitation rapidly “travels” across space to be converted in other forms of energy and finally used to complete the biological function. The whole machinery spans many different space and time scales: from the ultrafast electronic process localized at the subnanoscale of the chromophoric units, through conformational processes which involve large parts of the protein and are completed within micro- to milli-seconds, up to the activation of new protein-protein interactions requiring seconds or more. Theoretically addressing this cascade of processes calls for new models and computational strategies able to reproduce the dynamics across multiple space and time scales. Such a goal is formidably challenging as the interactions and the dynamics involved at each scale follow completely different laws, from those of the quantum world to those of classical particles. Only a strategy based upon the integration of quantum chemistry, classical atomistic and coarse-grained models up to continuum approximations, can achieve the required completeness of description. This project aims at developing such integration and transforming it into high-performance computing codes. The completeness and accuracy reached by the simulations will represent a breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanisms, which govern the light-driven bioactivity. Through this novel point of observation of the action from the “inside”, it will be possible not only to reveal the ‘design principles’ used by Nature but also to give a “practical” instrument to test “in silico” new techniques for the control of cellular processes by manipulating protein functions through light.',\n",
       " \"For a long time the lysosome has been viewed as a “static” organelle that performs “routine” work for the cell, mostly pertaining to degradation and recycling of cellular waste. My group has challenged this view and used a systems biology approach to discover that the lysosome is subject to a global transcriptional regulation, is able to adapt to environmental clues, and acts as a signalling hub to regulate cell homeostasis. Furthermore, an emerging role of the lysosome has been identified in many types of diseases, including the common neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson's and Alzheimer’s. These findings have opened entirely new fields of investigation on lysosomal biology, suggesting that there is a lot to be learned on the role of the lysosome in health and disease. The goal of LYSOSOMICS is to use “omics” approaches to study lysosomal function and its regulation in normal and pathological conditions. In this “organellar systems biology project” we plan to perform several types of genetic perturbations in three widely used cell lines and study their effects on lysosomal function using a set of newly developed cellular phenotypic assays. Moreover, we plan to identify lysosomal protein-protein interactions using a novel High Content FRET-based approach. Finally, we will use the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate a collection of cellular models for all lysosomal storage diseases, a group of severe inherited diseases often associated with early onset neurodegeneration. State-of-the-art computational approaches will be used to predict gene function and identify disease mechanisms potentially exploitable for therapeutic purposes. The physiological relevance of newly identified pathways will be validated by in vivo studies performed on selected genes by using medaka and mice as model systems. This study will allow us to gain a comprehensive understanding of lysosomal function and dysfunction and to use this knowledge to develop new therapeutic strategies.\",\n",
       " 'Traditional drug design relies on inhibition of enzymes or receptors with accessible hydrophobic pockets. The concept of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) promised to overcome this limitation. Following our discovery of the first PROTAC that induced selective protein degradation in vivo, this technology has seen a boost in academia and industry. Despite global research efforts, advances are so far incremental: (i) most focus is on degrading targets that can be liganded and are druggable with conventional inhibitors; (ii) currently, only 3 out of 600 E3 ligases can be exploited. Glue2Degrade aims to transform the pharmacologically targetable space of the proteome. The project is built on the hypothesis that molecular glues (MGs), non-chimeric small molecules that degrade target proteins by inducing cooperative binding to E3 ligases, are much more prevalent than anticipated. Lenalidomide and related immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are prime examples of the potential of MGs. Without a specific targeting moiety, IMiDs induce cooperative binding of the E3 ligase CRBN to undruggable proteins like IKZF1/3, thereby inducing their degradation. However, no technologies exist to rationally develop MGs that hijack other E3 ligases.  ERC-funding would allow us to address this limitation. Based on data generated in my laboratory, we will systematically identify novel MGs and their E3 ligases by innovating (i) phenotypic discovery strategies, and (ii) an orthogonal chemical genetics pipeline. To elucidate the mechanisms of novel MGs, we will (iii) conduct target identification via unbiased proteomics followed by (iv) chemical optimization and initial translational characterization. Glue2Degrade, if successful, will transform the engageable E3 space and identify novel MGs, thereby opening up the potential for therapeutic development of cell-, tissue-, and cancer-type specific chemical degraders for undruggable proteins.',\n",
       " 'Plasma cells (PC) secreting high-affinity antibodies are key for long-term immunity and the success of vaccines. PC are mainly generated within the germinal centre (GC), a microenvironment where B cells undergo affinity maturation and selection. The GC reaction guarantees that only B cells expressing immunoglobulin with the highest affinity for the antigen will commit to terminal differentiation. Stringent regulation is essential, as dysfunctional GC B cells can cause defective immunity, autoimmunity, or B-cell lymphomas.\\nAffinity maturation requires rapid changes in the B cell transcriptome and proteome to enable cell fate decisions. This is governed by the interplay of signal transduction pathways and regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Post-transcriptional control is key for rapid remodelling of gene expression, yet its role in terminal differentiation remains largely unexplored. The host lab pioneers the study of RNA-binding proteins (RBP) in lymphocyte development and has unpublished data indicating that the RBP ZFP36L1 inhibits terminal differentiation of B cells in vitro. The regulation and function of ZFP36L1 in GCs is however unknown.\\nIn this proposal I will build on the unique and multidisciplinary expertise of the host lab and my experience on post-transcriptional regulation and immunity to address how ZFP36L1 dictates fate decision of B cells. Uniquely available mouse models will allow me to study how signal strength and signal transduction control ZFP36L1 activity and its downstream implications for humoral immunity. Cutting-edge technologies will be employed to elucidate the dynamics of ZFP36L1-RNA interactions and how they in turn define the proteome and fate of GC B cells.\\nThis work will reveal the role of an important new regulator of PC differentiation, and will enable me to expand my knowledge, acquire new biochemical, bioinformatics and managerial skills, and facilitate my career development as an independent scientist.',\n",
       " 'In Fragment-Based Lead Discovery (FBLD) highly sensitive biochemical and biophysical screening technologies are used to detect the low-affinity binding of low-molecular-weight compounds (the so-called fragments) to biological targets that are involved in pathophysiological processes. Knowledge of the molecular interactions between fragment hit(s) and the target protein allows the rational generation of high-quality leads for drug development. Thus, high-resolution (e.g. X-ray crystallography) and relatively high-throughput structure determination technologies are key to this approach but they can become a limiting factor for both technical and economical reasons. As a matter of fact, when the experimental characterization of binding mode fails, the success rate of FBLD approaches drastically drops. To overcome current limitations in FLBD, here we propose the development of a computational framework based on advanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations to map the binding of fragments to protein surfaces on the proteome scale---thus generating the Fragmentome Altas. For each individual target this will allow to: a) systematically identify fragments binding to protein surfaces and cryptic pockets; b) reconstruct the mechanism of binding with atomistic spatiotemporal resolution; c) characterize the molecular determinants of affinity and kinetics in fragment-protein complexes. This insight is fundamental for optimizing and evolving fragments to lead compounds with desired thermodynamics and kinetics features. To date, neither experimental nor computational approaches can provide such information at affordable costs while maintaining the high throughput needed for screening campaigns. The successful implementation of this ambitious project lies in the unique combination of expertise of its participants, and it will allow a novel state-of-the-art for modern drug discovery to be established. The Fragentome Atlas will be a freely accessible on-line server.',\n",

It has been demonstrated that the current medical practice has led to frequent over-treatment of patients exhibiting slow growing PCa (unlikely to progress in the absence of treatment), while for metastatic castration resistant  patients that immediate treatment is required, no effective strategies are available. Therefore, new therapeutic options are required for advanced PCa. To address this clinical demand, PCaProTreat is focused on the comprehensive characterisation of the molecular background of PCa progression, based on which molecularly-driven therapeutic targets can be defined. Towards that end, PCaProTreat includes: a) multi-layer analysis (different types of specimens: tissue, urine, seminal plasma) and multi-omics profiling (proteomics, peptidomics, transcriptomics), supplemented with literature-mined data, b) establishment of the PCa knowledge database, c) data integration into Systems Biology workflow to identify key-regulatory elements responsible for disease progression (best suited drug targets) and d) validation of the selected targets using immunohistochemistry. This multi-dimensional approach represents a substantial advancement over the standards currently applied in drug discovery process, allowing to overcome the challenges associated with tumour heterogeneity and thus reveal optimal drug targets. In parallel to the research activities, a multi-disciplinary and multi-sectorial training program will be implemented to increase the competitiveness of the ER within the research community, to become a recognised researcher. Activities will be carried out in the industrial sector, with Mosaiques Diagnostics a leader in clinical proteomics and Systems Medicine, being a Host institution.',\n",
       " 'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health problem resulting in progressive liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma – the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Although HBV structure and genome have been characterized, key aspects of the viral life cycle remain poorly understood because of the lack of a robust HBV infectious tissue culture system. Moreover, despite the development of a safe and efficient vaccine, over 240 million people are chronically infected with HBV. Thus, the development of efficient anti-viral strategies to cure HBV infection remains a critical unmet medical need. To date, there is an important gap of knowledge in basic HBV biology that results in the lack of identified drug targets to cure chronic HBV infection. These limitations can now be overcome using a state-of-the-art HBV tissue culture model combined with technological advances in genetics and proteomics. The aim of HIPShot (Hbv genetIc and Proteomic Screen) is to use cutting-edge screening techniques in human cells to identify host factors that are essential for HBV infection and at the same time targets for antiviral cure. With my expertise in using forward genetic screening and proteomic approaches, I decided to join one of the leading groups in HBV research, lead by Prof. Thomas Baumert (TB) and based at Inserm Unit U1110 of Université de Strasbourg (UdS), to exploit novel technologies in the investigation of host-virus interaction. The proposed project will provide unmatched insights into the basic biology of HBV infection by shedding new light on cellular host factors exploited by HBV to replicate and persist in human cells. These identified host factors will constitute direct drug targets with an important therapeutic potential.',\n",

Viral pathogens are estimated to be responsible of ~12% of cancers worldwide and represent useful models for the study of oncogenesis mechanisms. Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer detected in ~2500 patients per year in Europe and has recently been linked with a clonal integration of the Merkel Cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) in more than 80% of cases. MCPyV is a 6-protein encoding system, expressing only two proteins with reported oncogenic functions. This limited proteome size thus allows system-wide study of its associated oncogenic mechanisms. This multi-pronged project consists of: (i) identifying the critical interactions of viral and host proteins in MCC oncogenesis; and (ii), using NOD scid mice cell line derived xenografts (CDXs), validate MCPyV host-proteins drug targeting strategies to combat MCC tumorigenesis. Using cutting-edge mass spectrometry-based techniques combined with CRISPR interference approaches in relevant human cancer cell systems, these studies will uncover new protein-protein interactions essential for tumorigenesis. MCPyV\\\\ MCC CDXs will be used to establish the functional relevance of novel virus-host protein interactions and to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting these host interactors as anti-cancer strategies. The application of these proteomic and functional approaches will allow for a better understanding of MCPyV-associated carcinogenesis. In a broader view, it will define a new framework for identifying druggable targets in pathogen-driven cancers. This project will underpin future translational researches, and hence appears as a fundamental step for therapeutic development.',\n",
       " 'We are proposing to target Innate Lymphoid Cells 2 (ILC2s), a subset that has been frequently implicated in inflammatory diseases, such as severe asthma. ILC2s are major players in allergic asthma and are abundantly present as tissue resident cells in the lung, both in human and mouse. Strikingly, the induction of allergic asthma in a mouse model deficient in ILC2s is abolished. In addition, the transfer of ILC2s back in the same mouse recapitulates the pathology. Mechanistically, activated ILC2s are the main producer of type 2 cytokines that sustain the chronicity of asthma by recruiting other inflammatory and pathogenic cells, notably eosinophils, and finally drive hyperresponsiveness and mucous hypersecretion. In humans, ILC2s are increased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with allergic asthma compared to healthy controls. They are also found in sputum and PBMCs of patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma compared to mild forms of asthma. Collectively, these data highlight the significance of ILC2s in allergic inflammation and emphasize the idea to target those cells for therapeutic purposes. MInfla-Tilc is a translational and integrated project aiming to launch an innovative therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment against ILC2s to control severe asthma.',\n",

Innovative solutions are required, such as urban stormwater reuse to enhance groundwater supplies. Stormwater contaminated with various substances could threaten valuable groundwater resources. Polar trace organic chemicals (TOrC) are of emerging concern as they are highly mobile in soil and data on the contamination risks are still scarce. Thus, a precautionary treatment is essential to improve stormwater quality prior to groundwater recharge. The StormTre project assesses the risks associated with TOrC in stormwater and their control with emerging, low-cost biochar systems. The project will be achieved through three tasks: i) field monitoring and risk assessment of TOrCs, ii) laboratory based treatment tests for challenging conditions, and iii) development of a forecasting model. The results will quantify the unknown risk associated with TOrC in stormwater – an important knowledge gap for stormwater reuse. The project will lead to design and operation recommendations for safe groundwater recharge. Hosted at Stanford University in the outgoing phase, Dr. Lena Mutzner (LM) will study water reuse systems in a stimulating environment, where water scarcity drives innovation towards water-smart cities. LM will enhance her skills in chemical analysis and deepen her knowledge in contaminant occurrence and treatment. In the return phase at Newcastle University, LM will be integrated in UK’s outdoor National Green Infrastructure Laboratory team, where she will be trained in microbial analysis and complement her scientific profile with biological process modelling knowledge.

Successful immobilisation of contaminants is documented, for instance, via nanomagnetite, although this solid is far less studied compared to other Fe oxides. Soil aggregates are natural systems ideal for the study of the (bio)geochemical reactions that control the mobility of the redox sensitive elements due to their small size and their spatial heterogeneity.

The SUSTAINABILITY of B-FERST is based on the reuse of bio-waste to replace non-renewable, non-domestic and energy intensive raw materials:\\n1) Bio-based solid fertilisers including renewable sources of macronutrients (N,P,K) obtained from 3 by-products streams: i) ashes, as source of P & K from: Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTP) (sewage sludges), & agri-food such as: slaughterhouse waste, olive & livestock wastes; ii) struvite as source of P & N from WWTP & agro waste (pig slurries), and; iii) compost as source of organic carbon compound, N, P & K from Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste) OFMSW, WWTP & agro waste  (manure -livestock-).\\n2) Biostimulants for soil nutrient improvement from two approaches: selected microbiological strains as Microbial Plant Biostimulant (MPB) or Non-Microbial Plant Biostimulant (NMPB) from cardoon oil meal processing (agricultural by-products) and compost extracts. Bio-degradable coatings based on biopolymers will be used when MPB is added to the fertiliser products to protect the beneficial microorganisms and guaranty their performance.\\nThe VIABILITY is based on previous R&D from other RIA projects. The manufacturing process will be demonstrated at a demonstrative industrial scale. Then specialised fertilisers will be performed and validated in 5 crops tests (Spain, Italy, France, Poland and Ukraine) comparing their functionality to that of traditional fertilisers in terms of: sustainable sourcing, logistics, soil and growing conditions, reaching a TRL6',\n",

Since the beginning, our CEO, Mr. Ahmed Alimi, focused all our efforts on the optimisation of laundering processes by means of cleaning and disinfecting solutions without the usage of detergent. This led us to develop a process that has a strong cleaning ability and a strong disinfecting ability consuming only three elements: electricity, water and salt.\\nWith AquaPure our aim is to develop a detergent free process for industrial and household dishwashers. This apparatus will be integrated in the dishwashers and will be capable of reducing the energy consumption per cycle (70%), reduce water consumption (50%), and decrease each washing cycle duration (20%). The innovative technology helps significantly reduce costs per cycle (Energy: household: 200kWh/year; industrial: 330-2830kWh/year; water used: household: 780L/cycle; industrial: 1.200-75.200-40L/year ) and dramatically reduce environmental impact.',\n",
       " 'The purpose of the research plan is the development of the method called Functional Analytical Approach (FAA) for the analysis of singular perturbations of nonlinear transmission problems. The techniques proposed are based on potential theory and functional analysis and aim at describing the effect of perturbations in terms of real analytic functions. Both perturbations of the shapes of the domains of definition and of the coefficients of the operators will be considered.  A special attention will be paid to the case of perforated and periodically perforated domains with shrinking holes and inclusions. The problems addressed are of interest also in view of inter-sectorial applications to the analysis of physical models in fluid dynamic, in elasticity, and in thermodynamic. Concrete applications will be shown in the study effective properties of composite materials, in inverse problems in acoustic and electromagnetic scattering, and in inclusion detection problems. The results obtained represent a novelty with respect to the existing literature for the following reasons:\\n\\n•\\tthe techniques of FAA are innovative with respect to the classical approaches existing in literature and allow the implementation of analytic functions in the description of the effect of perturbations;  \\n\\n•\\twe treat non-linear boundary value problems and transmission problems, which are relevant in application and present challenging difficulties; \\n\\n•\\twe will obtain new results of pure mathematics in the frame of potential theory.  In particular we will study the analyticity of certain nonlinear integral operators related to the layer  and volume potentials;\\n\\n•\\twe will show how to obtain explicit calculations and we will show concrete applications in continuum mechanics. \\n\\nThe final goal within the action is the realisation of a complete theory based on the FAA which will represent in future a key tool for the analysis of perturbed boundary value problems.',\n",

       " 'The Colombian peace process signed in 2016 has shown that even when peace agreements include comprehensive measures to tackle structural inequalities seen as the root causes of the conflict, they may still be rejected by the very societal groups meant to benefit from such transformative provisions. IPAP addresses this dilemma by exploring how peacebuilding institutions can implement a peace agreement that is contested and work to include groups who have engaged in antagonistic actions against the peace accord. The research counters a tendency in the literature to treat resistance against peacebuilding as deviance or abnormality or as a mere manifestation of political and economic elites’ fear of losing power, by including the intersectional politics which explains these groups’ undermining or rejection of the peace process. The objectives of IPAP are: 1) to identify the fabric of antagonistic forces to peace and map their relations with political actors; 2) to examine the intersectional systems of power differentials through which antagonistic subject positions emerge and analyse how they transform into agonistic, i.e. constructively conflictive, relations with the work of peacebuilding institutions; 3) to explore possibilities for peacebuilding institutions to gain sustained legitimacy among the local population; 4) to identify ways in which peace institutions might engage with difference and create spaces where adversaries can engage in agonistic dialogue. To achieve these objectives, IPAP uses a feminist intersectional lens to peacebuilding, and an ethnographic fieldwork approach, to empirically study Colombia as a rich case of antagonism to peacebuilding. The innovative approach of IPAP consists in advancing the notion of antagonistic subject positions to peace to identify the intersecting relations of power through which groups of population who resist peacebuilding processes are organized and how they can commit to agonistic dialogue.',\n",

Conserving historic urban environments is currently one of the most universally urgent and challenging cultural heritage conservation issues. The research project 'Hismacity-pro' aims to develop a detailed protocol of multidisciplinary integrated interventions targeted at the recovery and revitalization of small historic centers by enabling smart city services, in order to improve the quality of life in these settlements, which are usually confined within marginal areas, far from the biggest cities. The protocol will be able to be replicated in other southern European towns with the same needs. At the moment,  Italian small centers haven’t been rigorously mapped and requalified and local policies aimed at their recovery are quite absent, while the Italian Agency for Territorial Cohesion has recently set up a central policy for their valorisation. The protocol will be adoptable by this strategy and will convey an operative tool of guidance for municipalities in peripheral areas on policy management, in central Italy and Catalonia (Spain). The research will be grounded in an holistic management of sites and their surrounding context and will encourage a considerable increase in the competitiveness of small historic centers, as well as their conservation and economic sustainable growth. The project will assess the state of information available to practitioners and identify unmet needs in the conservation of historic cities and urban settlements. It will also try to find a response to how small historic towns can use local assets to revitalize their economy, and the logic of turning problems into resources will be adopted (“smart” growth).

It plays a strategic role in energy transition, being essential to achieve the decarbonisation objectives. But the big challenge that hinders the deployment of hydrogen as a real solution for zero-emissions mobility is how to transport and storage big quantities in a safe and economic way.\\nOur company HySiLabs has developed and patented an innovative hydrogen carrier called “HydroSil”, a liquid silicon hydride derivative, which is stable, non-toxic, non-explosive and non-dangerous. It enables to release hydrogen at the consumption site easily, on-demand and without any external energy input. Furthermore, it can be reused as many times as desired.\\nHydroSil is aimed to big energy companies aiming to supply hydrogen to the market. This solution allows them to use the existing logistic infrastructure for fossil fuel, thus revolutionising the hydrogen delivery sector. Its high hydrogen content enables to transport 7 times more H2 per truck than with high-pressure H2 gas, drastically reducing the operational costs and the related emissions. Our innovation will have a disruptive impact in the mobility sector as it has the potential to remove the barriers that currently prevent a wide deployment of hydrogen-based applications by tackling safety, regulatory and supply chain issues. Moreover, HydroSil is a unique carbon-free solution, suitable for onboard applications in heavy mobility (trucks, trains, maritime, etc.).\\nHySiLabs was created with the objective of developing and exploiting this new technology which is based in a recent scientific discovery.

       " 'Why is it so difficult to achieve further European political integration? This question motivates the first part of the project. The standard approach in economics presumes that integration of countries reflects a tradeoff between economic benefits and the cost of cultural heterogeneity. To assess this tradeoff, we exploit survey data to quantify cultural heterogeneity within and between EU countries, comparing it to the US. We also investigate time variation, to assess whether economic integration led to cultural convergence. Finally, exploiting regional variation, we seek to identify a cultural core and compare it to the economic core of the EU. We conjecture the following conclusion: although European economic integration has not led to cultural convergence, the primary obstacle to integration is not cultural heterogeneity per se, but the presence of other barriers, such as national identities or national institutions, which amplify its effects.\\nThe second part of the project studies the causes and implications of two related phenomena: the diffusion of nationalism and of political populism, with behavioral voters. We study nationalism as endogenous identification with one’s nation, and analyze how it interacts with political institutions and political processes in a setting of international policy coordination. We study populism as due to the reaction of disappointed voters who behave according to Prospect theory. Our main goal is to explain these behavioral phenomena, and to derive predictions about the effect of institutional reforms.\\nThe third part of the project examines Europe in the very long run.

       " \"Everyday actions involve an amount of uncertainty in the final outcome they will deliver. Following Knight's view, some of this uncertainty is “measurable” (Risk) while some of it is “not measurable” (Ambiguity). In Economics, understanding agents’ behavior under uncertainty is of fundamental importance. For many years, and in both contexts, the standard model of decision making has been the Expected Utility model. Since the famous thought experiments of Allais and Ellsberg, many alternative approaches and departures from Expected Utility were proposed.\\n\\nOur research agenda has two main goals. First, we aim to show how different approaches and concepts in Decision Theory are connected to each other: namely, incompleteness of preferences, violations of Independence, preference for randomization, the certainty effect, and random choice. Economists have long understood the relevance of these behavioral phenomena, and more and more models are now including them in applications, for example in Macroeconomics and Finance. A deeper understanding of these phenomena and of their relationship would significantly benefit research in several fields of Economics. More practically, it will help in developing comprehensive models in which these biases are linked to each other benefiting more applied research.\\n\\nSecond, decision theorists have studied Ambiguity mostly in static (atemporal) contexts that are insufficient for the analysis of the steady state and dynamic decision problems that characterize applications. Thus, for example, as a result, Macro-Finance mostly keeps relying on traditional decision models that cannot properly cope with model uncertainty. We intend to develop a general theory of recursive intertemporal preference models under uncertainty to address this important issue.\\n\\nWe expect that the novel theoretical findings of our research agenda will push the research frontier and will be relevant for the analysis of the role of uncertainty in several fields.\",\n",
       " 'Model uncertainty is a key issue and an active research area in Macro-Finance. Its study, pioneered by Hansen and Sargent, substantially improves the treatment of uncertainty in Macro-Finance models and the robustness of their conclusions. The interest of central banks on problems related to model uncertainty is a clear signal of the relevance of this novel concept and the related theoretical framework. Model uncertainty in Macro-Finance and ambiguity in Decision Theory share a common insight that inspires empirical and theoretical developments: the agents’ ignorance about the “true” probabilistic model that governs the uncertain environments they face. With few exceptions, decision theorists have studied ambiguity mostly in static contexts that are insufficient for the analysis of the steady state and dynamic decision problems that characterize Macro-Finance. Hence, this field keeps relying on decision models that cannot cope with model uncertainty.\\nOur research agenda aims to create a unified Macro-Finance and Decision Theory framework for the study of model uncertainty, which broadens the scope of Decision Theory and provides novel foundations for a common framework. We will build new steady state and dynamic decision models that are powerful enough for a general analysis of model uncertainty in Macro-Finance. We will also develop a self-confirming equilibrium analysis, which by leaving room for agents to have “wrong” views about models, can much more naturally confront agents with model uncertainty than the rational expectations approach. Our project will foster cross-fertilization and lead to a deeper understanding of the empirical and theoretical effects of uncertainty in Macro-Finance phenomena. Because model uncertainty is pervasive (e.g., which climate model to use? which is the correct production function for human capital?), we expect that our theoretical findings will push the research frontier and the analysis of the role of uncertainty in other fields.',\n",

       " 'Europe’s media industry lacks an effective business model for their online content, particularly in the context of falling revenues from traditional online advertising – they need new ways to effectively monetise their content.\\n\\nOur aim is to allow media to generate revenue from their online images. \\nWe apply innovative image-analysis technology to detect clothes in online images, and match them with clothes in retailers’ online product catalogues. This creates a lucrative collaboration between online media and retailers – for every customer redirected to a retailers’ website via an online image, media publications receive a commission fee.  \\n\\nAn initial version of this automated technology (running in under 300 milliseconds) has already been developed. We can recognise photos of clothes in isolation (an image of an item of clothing on a plain background) and match them to the clothes sold by our 8000 partner retailers (Amazon, H&M…). We then give readers the opportunity to click to find a link to buy the same or similar item. This solution has already been commercialised to several leading magazines (including Closer, Grazia & Be), who have seen online advertising revenues increase by up to 6 times.\\nHowever, photos of clothes in isolation represent only a small proportion of online images. \\n\\nOur ambition is therefore to adapt our technology to detect clothes in photos of people – representing a much larger proportion of online images. Online readers will be able to click to “Get the Look” of a celebrity or public figure in an online photo, and will be shown links to retailers selling similar items. The aim of our feasibility study is to refine the technological specifications and validate the commercial proof of concept with a base of current and potential clients. \\n\\nWith ShopStar, we are creating a non-invasive advertising solution that can be deployed to international media groups worldwide, positioning Shopedia as category leader for this disruptive new approach',\n",
       " 'Haemorrhoids is recognized as one of the most common medical conditions in general population, effecting up to 33% of the population under the age of 50 and up to 50% of the global population over 50-years old. Haemorrhoids are swellings containing enlarged blood vessels found inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus). They occur when the rectal mucosa falls down from its normal position, causing problems like bleeding, soiling, itching and soreness, redness and swelling. Currently available treatments like surgeries are highly invasive and are associated with postoperative pain, high frequency of relapse, stenosis (narrowing of rectum), faecal or air incontinence and long recovery time (up to 1 month). In severe cases, surgery is the only option and modern surgical treatments focus on preserving and restoring the haemorrhoids, but they are still very expensive and not affordable for almost all population affected. Developeration has developed PexyEazy®, a novel medical device aiming to revolutionize the surgical treatment of haemorrhoids. The single-use, small (<26mm in diameter) device is based on a well-documented treatment method called mucopexy by which the haemorrhoid is lifted back to its normal position by applying running sutures in the mucosa above the haemorrhoid. This reduces the swelling of the haemorrhoid and the symptoms disappear. With PexyEazy®, haemorrhoid operations can be performed without the requirement of general anaesthesia, with less postoperative complications and in only 10 minutes, resulting in significant cost savings of 70% each procedure. During the phase 1 project, a go-to-market strategy and a supply chain will be established, as well as further development plan will be drafted. Within the overall innovation project, Developeration AB will conduct clinical trials with hospitals in Sweden, where they will initially market their product, along with scaling up for commercialization.',\n",

CSR today has evolved from a nice-to-have commodity to a fundamental strategic priority for both small and large businesses. However implementing a CSR programme that is aligned with a company’s core business strategy is difficult and resource intensive.   Most often, especially for small and medium enterprises, CSR ends up being a sponsorship or simply providing funds for some cause.  This form of CSR does not provide long term results and the impact is low for both parties.\\nOn the other hand, NGOs seek funds and resources to run their programs and initiatives.  Typically Fund Raising Managers are employed, with NGOs on full/part time salaries to be able to raise funds for their needs.  This approach has several drawbacks: 1) the funds and resources obtained are limited to the reach of the fund raiser, 2) the cost (salary) of a fund raiser is high, especially for medium to small size NGOs, 3) the fund raiser is not part of the core strategy of the NGO and hence their offering, in return to businesses supporting the NGOs cause is mostly marketing.  \\nYellow Harbour is essentially a solution to the above mentioned issues.  Yellow Harbour is a new business model based on the servitisation of CSR development, planning and management for business and NGOs.

Artists will increase job opportunities by maximizing their talent, repertoire and availability. Also their income will grow through the reduction of booking fees from 10-20% to 6%. The decrease public funding for the cultural sector and the increase of freelance contracts for artists are challenges that arts organisations and artists are facing at global/ EU level. The expected outcome of our feasibility study is a new algorithm for peer review to make the artistic quality assessments data-driven and remove bias from evaluations. It is currently a challenge to use data to judge the artistic quality of artists, as this normally done by humans. For 2020 the projections are 132,000 artists and 1,100 arts organisations on our online platforms with booking values estimated at €1.3bn generating €67 in revenues. This will allow TrueLinked to secure a share of global and European booking market. Future risks concern peer reviews being statistically insignificant or peer reviews detracting artists from TrueLinked.

The proposed concept is based on the deployment & integration of existing & planned project clusters across 6 locations in the Northern Netherlands, namely Eemshaven, Delfzijl, Zuidwending, Emmen, Hoogeveen and Groningen, with a total initial investment of 88 M EUR. The main goal is to make use of green hydrogen across the entire value chain, while developing replicable business models for wide-scale commercial deployment of H2 across the entire regional energy system. HEAVENN aims to maximize the integration of abundant RES resource available in the region, both onshore (wind and solar) and offshore wind, using H2 as: (i) a storage medium to manage intermittent and constrained renewable inputs in the electricity grid; and (ii) an energy vector for further integration of renewable inputs and decarbonisation across other energy sectors beyond electricity, namely industry, heat and transportation. The project facilitates the deployment of 11 HFC end-user applications across the project clusters, while ensuring the interconnection between them. This will be delivered by facilitating the deployment of key transport & distribution gas infrastructure to deliver green H2 from supply to the end-user sites. In this way HEAVENN will demonstrate the coupling the existing electricity and gas infrastructures at scale, to decarbonize industry, power, transport and heat across the entire region.

The presently most widely used anti-CD20 antibody treatment rituximab has considerably improved treatment options for patients with B-cell malignancies. However, effectiveness is limited by resistance to rituximab and reduced response on repeated treatments. Data indicates that tumor expression of CD32b is directly involved in the development of resistance to rituximab. CD32b has the potential to be used as predictive biomarker for critical clinical decisions for rituximab and related treatments, and will impact payers and patients. In addition, our company is developing a novel treatment – BI-1206 that specifically targets CD32b and significantly improves antitumor effects of rituximab alone. As such, the CD32b biomarker assay has the additional potential to become a companion diagnostic for BI-1206 and other future B-cell malignancy treatments. Our company and the affiliated research team have developed a flow cytometry assay for the detection of the CD32b receptor on tumor cells. The assay has been partially validated in a clinically relevant setting to demonstrate CD32b as a predicative biomarker of therapy response. To achieve market uptake of our technology, we aim to conduct a number of studies together with selected clinical partners in Europe.

Advances in drilling technology through thick ice shelves in the beginning of the 21st century enabled sampling of such lakes and led to the discovery of unique communities of microorganisms adapted to extreme conditions. AstroLakes will sequence and analyse metagenomes from one such subglacial lake, Skaftárkatlar, sampled in 2007, 2014 and 2015. The results will support the development of an ecosystem model by estimating the functional contribution of the communities at different depths and locations in the lake. \\nNew isolates and genomes will be obtained through two complementary approaches, cultivation and single-cell sequencing. The cultivation approach will be achieved by designing culture and isolation media adapted to extremophiles with the information acquired from metagenomes. The single-cell approach involves the development of cytometry cell sorting and single-cell sequencing. This will expand the sequencing expertise at the host organisation, Matís.

       " 'The existence of liquid water is one of the few preconditions for life as we know it. Therefore, the search and characterization of liquid water outside of Earth plays an essential role in the search for extraterrestrial life. Prominent candidates to host liquid water are moons in the outer solar system, which can maintain oceans under their icy surfaces. The currently most effective way to identify such subsurface oceans is through effects of their salinity and thus electrical conductivity. The conductivity modifies the magnetic field around these moons through a process referred to as electromagnetic induction. Spacecraft measurements of associated magnetic field perturbations provided evidence for oceans within Jupiter’s moon Europa and Ganymede. Current analysis tools however reached an impasse. No scientific techniques are available, which provide quantitative estimates and uncertainties of key ocean properties when the effects of the dense magnetized plasmas around the moons are included. Here we propose entirely new approaches, which overcome these issues. Our novel techniques will include a simultaneous treatment of the physics in all internal and external conductive layers and will for the first time use all available observations including auroral emission to go beyond considering magnetic fields only. EXO-OCEANS will systematically characterize the ocean properties on Europa and Ganymede including the ocean candidate Callisto. Characterizing the oceans on Ganymede, Europa and Callisto are at the heart of ESA’s Juice and NASA’s Europa Clipper missions. For Saturn’s moons Titan and Enceladus where currently existing techniques do not work, we will invent a new detection technique.

       " 'Tc99m is the most widely used isotope in nuclear medicine. Production is almost exclusively done with a few ageing research reactors worldwide. Recent shutdowns of some those reactors have resulted in a worldwide Tc99m shortage. Europe is affected, because it is the second largest consumer of Tc99m worldwide. In response to growing concerns about Tc99m availability and the increasing demand in medicine, alternative production routes are being explored in the community. Direct production by proton cyclotrons looks the most promising solution. Cyclotrons offer several advantages, one of them being the possibility for local production, as is done for other commonly used medical isotopes. Large-scale production of Tc99m requires high proton beam intensities. InnovaTron focuses on a cutting-edge research project in accelerator design. The key challenge is the design of an innovative compact high-intensity cyclotron, named ‘self-extracting cyclotron’. In this machine, the proton beams exit without using an extraction device. Such devices usually prevent the extraction of high beam currents as would be needed for Tc99m production. A prototype machine was built by the company IBA around the year 2000. Self-extraction was successfully proven by extracting a current close to 2 mA. However, rather poor beam quality was observed resulting in too high machine activation and a maximum extraction efficiency not larger than 80%. This was encouraging but not yet good enough for industrial applications. InnovaTron will improve the magnet design and the beam-optics of the self-extracting cyclotron based on new technological solutions. It will be realized using high-level computer-aided design and beam physics studies. Key goals are: i) high currents up to 10 mA or more, ii) extraction efficiency higher than 95%, iii) beam quality at least a factor three better than the prototype. \\nThis cyclotron will allow production of high quantities of Tc99m and other frontier medical isotopes.',\n",

A fixed-target experiment at such a high energy offers many physics opportunities related to the the parton content of the nucleon and nucleus at high-x, the nucleon spin and the Quark-Gluon Plasma. Feasibility of beam halo deflection using crystal channeling has been experimentally demonstrated at CERN, for both proton and lead ion beams. There are two main objectives of the proposal.

The detector response and physics reach will be evaluated in collaboration with the ALICE experts, mostly from the Warsaw University of Technology (WUT). The proposal assumes a transfer of applicant's knowledge and experience obtained at CERN related to particle accelerators, collimation and crystals to an interdisciplinary project. In return, WUT is a partner providing the necessary expertise on particle physics and the ALICE detector.

However, despite the numerous monitoring and conservation efforts, our ability to predict and mitigate the extinction risk of wild populations remains limited. Assessing the temporal variation in genetic diversity and its environmental drivers represents a powerful approach to address this challenge, but incorporating it into conservation planning has been hindered by i) lack of affordable technology, ii) lack of interdisciplinarity, and iii) disconnection between fundamental research and applied conservation. BEEP will address these gaps by combining modern sequencing technologies for quantifying species temporal genomic erosion, with satellite observations of the earth for assessing the corresponding environmental change. By bridging diverse technological fields and scientific principles, BEEP will provide an applied predictive framework for species extinction risk in response to human pressure that can be directly utilised by major environmental organisations (IUCN, EEA, IPBES).

       " 'Landslides are a primary erosion process in steep landscapes and are among our most deadly and damaging geohazards. However, it is extremely difficult to constrain long-term or past rates of landslide activity, which prevents accurate predictions of their activity in the face of climate change. This project aims to develop and apply a new methodology to quantify long-term landslide activity and contribution to sediment fluxes. To achieve this goal, I will integrate two growing research lines that have identified signatures of landslide activity: grain-size distributions and cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) concentrations, which I will integrate in a numerical model. We will exploit, for the first time to our knowledge, the differences in depth production profiles between CRNs (14C and 10Be), using the 14C/10Be ratio to infer erosional depth-provenance and track erosional processes. We will sample grain-size distributions, and 14C and 10Be concentrations across different grain sizes, in landslide deposits and river sediments within catchments with excellent published constraints on landslide activity in Italy and New Zealand. We will develop a new Matlab numerical model, which will be calibrated using our new data, to determine landslide rates and fluxes using CRN and grain-size data, hence creating a tool that can be used to predict long-term or past landslide activity in other areas where good constraints are not available. This project has the potential to expand the uses of CRNs to include erosional depth-provenance. Furthermore, being able to infer long-term and past landslide rates would be a major step forward in how we tackle landscape evolution and landslide hazards. This project will be developed at the GFZ Potsdam (host) and ETH Zurich (secondment), bringing together outstanding infrastructures and researchers, and offering the best possible environment for my training and networking, which will in turn enhance my future career opportunities.',\n",

Dome building volcanoes, in specific, grow by magma extrusion and are partially destroyed again, posing a significant hazard in form of pyroclastic flows and other processes. The explosion at Merapi (Indonesia) in 2010, and at Colima volcano (Mexico) in 2013 are good examples of associated dramatic topographic changes. There is only limited understanding of the deformation style of the dome and the stress changes within and beneath, because sophisticated geodetic methods are hazardous to operate and are even destroyed during eruptions.

Larger scale displacements (>.1 m/yr) will be determined by time-lapse camera arrays that allow the visual recording of volcano summits from different viewing geometries, together with photogrammetric and image correlation approaches. This displacement data of the studied volcanoes shall allow to develop statistical and numerical models to investigate (i) how dome displacements affect the further magma extrusion position, (ii) how large morphology changes in the volcano summit affect dome growth by topographic loading or unloading, (iii) how dome growth is affected by extrinsic triggers such as tectonic quakes, and (iv) how simultaneous displacement processes such as cooling, extrusion and gravity driven deformation interfere.\\nThe P.I., with yearlong experience in modern geodetic methods, modelling and physical volcanology, herein describes the VolCapse project with the goal to enlighten our understanding of the coupled processes occurring during the different stages of volcano growth and collapse.

       " 'A new automated water sampling technology was developed under the ERC Consolidator Grant STEEPclim with the potential to revolutionize environmental monitoring worldwide. A changing climate and growing scarcity of water strongly increase the need of reliable standardized and highly automated environmental monitoring, thus creating a growing market for our innovative solution. Our first prototype successfully operated under field conditions. Now we seek funding to further develop this device and explore commercialization pathways.  Today, rain water, river discharge and climate are monitored routinely with high temporal resolution using quality sensors, but no adequate automated technology for obtaining representative samples for laboratory grade analysis is available for weather services, hydromet offices, chemical industry or research institutions. So far taking, preserving and analyzing samples from natural waters is meticulous, labor intensive and expensive. Isotope signatures in water are ideal tracers of processes in the water cycle.  Stable isotope analysis of precipitation can identify changing atmospheric circulation patterns and the origin of groundwater. They can also be used for the reconstruction of paleoclimate from ancient waters locked in geological archives. The analysis of fruits, food and drink products, of drugs, explosives and human remains is used to identify their regional provenance. For this purpose a robust understanding of the modern distribution of isotopes in space and time is indispensable. The autonomous and robust sampler introduced here is designed to fulfill the high demands on sampling and storage for isotope analysis. It is portable, has low power consumption and can be accessed remotely for maintenance and to adapt the sampling protocol strategy. The obtained water samples are not restricted to isotope analysis but can be used for any type of environmental water analysis.',\n",
       " 'Under the threat of ongoing global warming, predictions concerning how much temperatures will rise and precipitation will change are undergoing continual improvement, but the spatial distribution of predicted changes and their impacts on Earth-surface processes, notably erosion and sedimentation, are subject to great uncertainty. Such processes have immediate consequences for people living along alluvial or “transport-limited” rivers, which constitute the majority of rivers on Earth, yet their evolution in response to external forcing conditions is not well understood. In the GyroSCoPe project, I will address these knowledge gaps through an innovative approach that focuses on how periodic changes in climate affect Earth-surface processes. Specifically, because the dominant forcing frequencies have changed through time (notably at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, MPT), and the frequency of each forcing period likely dictates how far downstream in alluvial channels impacts are felt, it should be possible to decipher the impacts of individual periodic forcings in the geologic record. To do this, I will apply novel tools to decipher erosion histories in mountainous regions, specifically at the MPT, and I will investigate alluvial fans and terraces in the context of a new numerical model developed by my group. These data will allow me to interpret the impact of a change in the dominant forcing period on hillslope erosion rates, track how this sediment propagates across landscapes through alluvial rivers, and thus provide a wealth of data that can be used to calibrate landscape-evolution and alluvial-channel models. This improved understanding of the fundamental impacts of the magnitude and frequency of periodic forcing on erosion rates and sediment transport through rivers will in turn enable (1) the use of terraces and fans as paleoclimate proxies, which can be used to test climate models and (2) predicting Earth-surface responses to ongoing and future climate changes.',\n",

The chemical weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals is a key component of Earth’s climate system by exchanging large volumes of carbon between atmospheric and geologic reservoirs.

However, the majority of fresh, weatherable sediment on Earth’s surface is produced in active mountain ranges where unsteady bedrock landsliding is the dominant erosion process. There, existing weathering models do not apply. The lack of data and models for chemical weathering in bedrock landslide deposits presents a major knowledge gap that limits our predictions of weathering dynamics and, ultimately, our understanding of Earth’s climate system. \\n\\tThe goal of WetSlide is to quantify the impact of landslide erosion on chemical weathering fluxes from mountain ranges with three research objectives: 1) Assess millennial-scale variations of weathering rates in landslide deposits with a unique dataset of landslide-seepage-water chemistry from New Zealand; 2) Quantify erosion timescales of landslide deposits by measuring and compiling deposit volumes of dated landslides; 3) Develop and calibrate a model for weathering in landslides based on data from 1-2. This model will be combined with a regolith weathering model to estimate landscape-scale weathering fluxes. By providing the first quantitative study of weathering in landslide deposits, WetSlide has the potential to re-define the impact of mountain belt uplift on the inorganic carbon cycle and to drive a step-change in the understanding of global chemical weathering dynamics.

JUSTINT will apply Quantitative Text Analysis and Conversation Analysis to interactions in face-to-face and virtual deliberative domains (courts, parliaments, civil society debates, blogs, Web-based comments, and Twitter).\\n\\nThis mixed-method research will deliver fine-grained multi-language empirical analysis of patterns of discourse in four former Yugoslav countries (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Croatia), selected as a typical case of post-conflict justice practices. It will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team (three political scientists with expertise in peacebuilding, post-conflict justice and political behaviour, a gender specialist, a computational linguist and a quantitative text analyst).\\n\\nJUSTINT will generate a theory of justice interactions, and open up significant new research horizons at the intersection of peacebuilding and deliberation. It will break new ground by studying justice discourses at the level of words and conversational sequences through interdisciplinary integration and methodological innovation.',\n",

This study is crucial to understand how communities living in the Channel coastlands became interdependent at a time when trade in tin and copper was strenghtening the foundations for an extensive prehistoric European union. Central to the project is the study of burials within their human, social, and natural environments using Geographical Information System (GIS) analysis. The project is interdisciplinary, rooted in archaeology but borrowing concepts, methods, and data from geography and environmental sciences. This project will enable the fellow to achieve the research and transferable skills, which will allow him to become a mature independent researcher and international expert of the EBA northwestern Europe. The fellow will be able to apply the most up-to-date GIS skillset to different problems in the field of prehistoric archaeology, which will extend an exciting research career. This project offers the opportunity to the fellow to conduct innovative research and transnational mobility while providing benefits for the European Research Area, the Bournemouth University, the supervisor, the partner organisation and the fellow. This project will allow the fellow to develop a research agenda that will lead to a range of research and consultancy projects with European academic and non-academic institutions for the better understanding of EBA societies and cross-Channel relationships, thus enhancing research excellence and addressing recognized research questions in Europe, and beyond. Finally, the fellow aims to offer civil society the demonstration of how and why both sides of the Channel became socially and economically interdependent in the past is relevant to considering the future of our societies.',\n",

Many predicted it would also effectively complement traditional media and improve news reporting. These expectations have not been met. There is no evidence that citizens have become more informed; they have, however, become more ideologically polarized, possibly due to online media overexposing users to like-minded content. At the same time, traditional media are struggling: competition from online platforms has slashed advertising revenues forcing newspapers to close or downsize. These changes risk undermining the quality of reporting and making media more vulnerable to capture by special interests.\\nMy project examines how the Internet has transformed the way news is produced and disseminated, both directly and through its influence on traditional media, and its ultimate effect on media independence and content quality. To this end, I tackle four distinct but intertwined questions. First, I examine to what extent Google search results are tailored to users’ political views, and whether personalized results increase ideological polarization. Second, I study how lower advertising revenues affect newspapers’ organization and content quality by exploiting the staggered introduction of advertising platform Craigslist across the US. Third, I examine how media dependence on advertisers influences news bias by testing the relationship between advertising spending by car manufacturers and coverage of car safety recalls in US newspapers. Finally, I study how the dependence of media on banks affects coverage of financial issues; focusing on Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, I test whether newspapers linked to banks with higher exposure to risky debt endorsed different crisis-management measures.\\nMy results will shed light on the deep transformations the media industry is undergoing and their implications for the quality of democracy.',\n",
       " \"The principal objective of The Other Post-Criticism (TOPCRIT) is to bring women’s innovative knowledge production in the field of contemporary literary criticism into a broader, more challenging definition of the novel concept of post-criticism. This ICT-enabled project uses a combination of interdisciplinary scholarship and innovative technologies to document, research and disseminate exciting forms of critical and interpretive production by women authors, building on the candidate’s proven track record in this original and distinctive line of research. The project’s interdisciplinary framework harnesses state-of-the-art theorisations of gender to challenge the current binding of post-criticism to a predominantly male philosophical legacy. Seeking to influence the paradigm of the post-critical at a decisive moment in its young history, and working at the cutting edge of debate on the function, forms and continued relevance of literary criticism, TOPCRIT provides the first account to date of women’s post-critical writing – including the use of generic experimentation, performance aesthetics, digital technologies, and a radical reimagining of the essay form –, situating these innovations alongside compelling theoretical discussions of post-criticism by women. TOPCRIT’s project design has at its core a strategy to ensure the maximum impact and visibility of the research, sharing outputs in formats and contexts designed to influence not only state-of-the-art academic debate and curricular models, but, through a vibrant outreach strategy, to spark wider public interest in the ways ‘literary’ texts and forms can perform key critical functions. Aligned with the objectives of the Horizon 2020 Sixth Societal Challenge (‘Europe in a Changing World: Inclusive, Innovative, and Reflective Societies’), the project is designed to document and highlight marginalised cultural production by women, strengthening women's key role in contemporary critical conversation.\",\n",

Using these new measurement opportunities could reduce respondent burden, improve data quality, and extend measurement into new domains, allowing to answer questions that could not be answered so far and to improve the decisions of key actors (e.g. government). This could open the door to a whole range of completely groundbreaking research, providing new knowledge, and affecting key aspects of our societies.\\nWhile many people speak about these ideas, very little research has implemented such possibilities, and even less has assessed the data quality associated with such approaches. Thus, there is a huge need for further research in this area.\\nThe main goal of this project is to investigate how some of these new measurement opportunities that the growing presence of mobile devices made possible can help scientists and practitioners to get more accurate and/or more complete insights, by addressing three crucial research questions:\\n1.

       " 'Two of the main research threads in AI revolve around the development of data-based learners capable of inferring behavior and  functions from experience and data, and model-based solvers capable of tackling well-defined but intractable models like SAT, classical planning, and Bayesian networks. Learners, and in particular deep learners, have achieved considerable success but result in black boxes that do not have the flexibility, transparency, and generality of their model-based counterparts. Solvers, on the other hand, require models which are hard to build by hand. RLeap is aimed at achieving an integration of learners and solvers in the context of planning by addressing and solving the problem of learning first-order planning representations from raw perceptions alone without using any prior symbolic knowledge. The ability to construct first-order symbolic representations and using them for expressing, communicating, achieving, and recognizing goals is a main component of human intelligence and a fundamental, open research problem in AI.  The success of RLeap requires the development of radically new ideas and methods that will build on those of a number of related areas that include planning,  learning, knowledge representation, combinatorial optimization and SAT. The approach to be pursued  is based on a clear separation  between learning the  symbolic representations themselves, that is cast as a combinatorial problem,  and learning the interpretations of those representations, that is cast as a supervised learning problem from targets obtained from the first part. RLeap will address both problems, not just in the planning setting but in the generalized planning setting as well where plans are general strategies.

Tackling O/O is a European priority, and innovative actions to achieve this are urgently needed: no country has so far succeeded in reducing its growth. O/O are related to several axes of social inequality, such as socioeconomic status, gender, ethnicity, age, and place of residence. O/O are more frequent in more unequal societies and increase with urbanisation. The highly urbanised Iberia-Latin American region has strong historical, political, economic and cultural bonds. However, this region has also considerable heterogeneity in the degree of social and gender inequalities (SGI), urbanisation, and in the prevalence of O/O. Thus, this transnational scenario holds great potential for the analysis of the urban SGI in O/O. \\nThe overall objective of this project is to develop an analytical model to assess the determinants of SGI in O/O in the Iberia-Latin American cities over a recent time period, and to inform urban policies by integrating interdisciplinary, intersectional and intersectoral approaches. A mixed methods study design will be applied, with a cross-sectional multi-city study followed by a public policy analysis and the development of recommendations for polices and interventions to address SGI in O/O. A gender perspective will be adopted throughout all the action. The novel integration of these approaches will contribute to tackling urban SGI in O/O by providing a more comprehensive understanding of its drivers and by finding new avenues for improving equity-based urban policies. The project will also provide insights to reshape O/O as a systemic problem worldwide. Moreover, the action will have a key impact on my career development, on the institutions involved, and on relevant target audiences (researchers, practitioners, policy makers) as well as on the wider community.',\n",

Wage inequality has risen sharply, and most of the wage gains have been appropriated by the top 1%. In addition, labor market dynamism and new startups have declined, the labor share of total output has fallen, low skilled wages have stagnated, and there has been reallocation of production from small to superstar firms. During the same four decades, there has also been a sharp secular increase in market power. Firms set higher prices, profit rates are higher, and scale economies are up.\\nIn this proposal, I address the question whether these secular trends are related. Specifically, I ask whether the rise of market power has caused these profound macroeconomic changes. The objective is to uncover economic mechanisms that help understand this fundamental transformation and the implications for efficiency and welfare.\\nI propose to investigate both the causes of the rise in market power and its macroeconomic consequences. I distinguish between causes that stem inherently from the market structure (such as antitrust enforcement and Mergers & Acquisitions) and those that result from technological change (economies of scale, intangible assets, and network externalities). Methodologically, this research proposal aims to contribute to the literature on three fronts: 1. the measurement of markups, 2. to derive theoretical results linking market power and macroeconomic consequences, 3. to estimate and quantitatively evaluate these models. The close link between the macroeconomic consequences and the causes of market power renders this a research proposal at the intersection of macro/labor, industrial organization and law & economics. The objective is to inform the policy debate: how to keep market power under control in order to remediate its macroeconomic consequences that were hitherto considered independent.',\n",

Screening options are used in EU for the early detection of CRC and the most likely one (after positive faecal test) is the endoscopy. However, the reduced field of vision of the endoscopic camera (<180°), the non-homogenous illumination, the polyp concealment due to angulations and folds of the colon or poor colon cleansing, and the dependence on the experience of the clinician who performs endoscopy, result in lack of efficacy of this technique. It is estimated that after a negative colonoscopy the risk of having CRC is 60-70%.\\nThe host has just invented MiWEndo, a low cost system of microwave image generation for clinical endoscopic applications. The pre-prototyped device is a small endoscope head composed by an array of antennas that transmits and receives microwave signals, and it will form anatomical and functional images of the interior of the gastro-intestinal tract as the endoscope travels along it. The goal is to provide real-time (360°) images in endoscopic explorations and interventions, offer a better understanding of the CRC behavior (by allowing quantification), and guide diagnosis and therapy.

In this sense, three broad hypotheses will guide my work to measure the impact of digital democracy on individual participation, information quality and legislative outcomes. To do so, I am planning to: 1) Develop a taxonomy to organize and analyse CrowdLaw practices; 2) Conduct mixed-methods research to evaluate different CrowdLaw modalities and their legal frameworks and 3) Transform two local legislatures (Barcelona and Madrid) into CrowdLaw living labs to be able to conduct experiments that allow me to test how CrowdLaw initiatives impact the legitimacy and quality of lawmaking.

Music schools and teachers have now access to a much wider audience, increasing their business opportunities specially by overcoming the geographical constraints. However, online music performance education cannot scale to MOOC level given that the student assessments rely on individual instructor review, as is the case in the well known online courses from Berklee Online. The need of a personal assessment procedure limits the growth and expansion of these courses.\\n\\nOur project, TECSOME, will solve this limitation by facilitating the learner’s assessment, making it more automatic and less human-dependent. We will build an automatic assessment system, named Music Critic, around a set of technologies developed within the CompMusic project, targeted at supporting music performance courses and helping them scale up to MOOC level. Music Critic will act as an external assessment tool able to communicate with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) via the Learning Tool Interoperability standard (LTI). The basic workflow will be: (1) teacher prepares an exercise using the LMS and Music Critic; (2) learner uploads an audio recording of the exercise to the LMS; (3) LMS sends the audio recording to Music Critic, where is analyzed and evaluated; and (4) Music Critic sends the assessment outcome, which includes the evaluation grade and detail feedbacks, to the LMS, where it can be corrected and validated by the teacher before becoming available to the learner. \\n\\nIn the CompMusic project we have developed technologies with which to analyze music recordings in various music styles. Some of the technologies are already being exploited in a PoC project, CAMUT, which takes advantage of music analysis technologies that target the Indian musical culture.

       " 'Over the last three years, millions have attempted to cross the EU frontier. Some are fleeing war and persecution; others poverty. The EU has struggled to find an acceptable response. It is aware that the denial of legal entry encourages risky crossings and that many of those migrating are refugees. Yet it is also keen to limit immigration. It has therefore responded by insisting on a sharp distinction between refugees and economic migrants, making some exceptions for the former, while seeking to exclude the latter. It has also obtained an agreement with Turkey that permits the EU to return migrants in exchange for various benefits. This response seems to have been effective in limiting migration along the Turkey-Greece route. Nevertheless, the large numbers migrating along other routes, the lack of sufficient protection for many refugees and the high death toll at sea, all cast doubt on the adequacy of the EU response.  This research project will be the first within ethical theory to address the ethics of migration in the context of the Mediterranean crisis. It will assess how EU states should respond to such large waves of migration. It focusses on three questions. First, which migrants are entitled to protection? International law and EU policy single out refugees, but the research project will investigate whether states have duties towards other migrants as well. Second, of those who are entitled to protection, where should they be protected? The EU-Turkey agreement effectively involves the outsourcing of protection to Turkey. Such “safe third country” agreements are ethically controversial. Third, if it is permissible to exclude some migrants, how should they be excluded? Given the numbers that are currently dying while trying to evade migration restrictions, it is important to explore the various methods of restriction to see which, if any, are ethically defensible and, given the current regulatory framework, legally feasible.',\n",

Satellites are part and parcel of knowledge society.  In particular, satellite images and calibrated measurements contribute to generate technical information about nuclear accidents, as well as to convey the public perception of them, forge debates on nuclear energy, its management and its risks, and shape environmental, regulatory and political action. Satellite data are both resources that enable regulators and policy-makers to act during and after nuclear crises as well as instruments to communicate with the large public.  But how policy guidance is carried out to manage nuclear situations and how public perception of nuclear risks is constructed from, through and with satellite data?

       " 'Within the eAXON project, which is funded by an ERC CoG, we are developing a technology for neuroprosthetics which consists of wireless microstimulators whose operation is based on rectification of galvanically conducted bursts of high frequency current. In addition to the microstimulators technology, we have conceived and protected a technology for the development of implantable sensing systems with an unprecedented level of minimal invasiveness. The sensing technology consists of a very thin implant and an external unit able to wirelessly interrogate the implant for obtaining measurements related to physical or chemical magnitudes in the implant or in its vicinity. In contrast to previous implantable sensing technologies, our technology allows the implementation of thread-like implants; flexible and very thin (diameter < 1 mm). Such level of miniaturization is possible because our technology avoids the need of bulky components within the implants (e.g. batteries or coils) for power and communications. The proposed PoC project is essentially intended to pave the way for a spin-off company aimed at further developing and clinically validating the technology for a specific clinical need.',\n",

       " 'One of the most intriguing complex functions of the brain is its ability to transform sensory information into distinct neural representations that can be used for perception and action. Sensory inputs mediated by visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory streams drive experience-dependent learning. In particular, to form memories of the perceived outside world, characteristic visual features of the environment need to be processed by the hippocampus, a brain region that is critical for episodic memory storage in mammals. However, it is still unclear how visual properties of different environments can drive the formation of separate memories. It has been suggested that the hippocampal dentate gyrus is required to produce distinct memories in a process termed pattern separation. In particular, newly generated granule cells, which are continuously incorporated into the existing adult neuronal network, appear to be essential for this process. \\nTo understand how visual features of similar stimuli are processed in the hippocampus to drive the formation and storage of distinct memories, I will combine novel optical methods to record the activity of newly generated and mature granule cells from the hippocampal dentate gyrus with simultaneous local field potential recordings from primary visual cortex. These experiments will be performed on head-fixed mice running in a linear virtual-reality environment while discriminating a visually-driven behavioural task, and will allow me to answer the following questions: i) How do distinct visual cues drive the formation of separate hippocampal representations? ii) In turn, how is hippocampus-dependent memory formation involved in visual experience-dependent learning? My results will provide fundamental insights into the cellular mechanisms of memory formation and will address a core question in neuroscience, how different brain regions interact to create the mental representation of the outside world.',\n",

Benzonitrile provides a key link to benzene, which may be a low-temperature precursor to more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Understanding the origin of PAHs will help answer fundamental questions about their role in forming interstellar dust as well as potentially prebiotic molecules—material that may be incorporated into new planetary systems. \\nComputational models are used to pinpoint individual chemical pathways by inputting kinetic rates of various formation and destruction reactions and aiming to reproduce the molecular abundances determined by radio astronomy.

       " 'Since a few decades, “genealogy” has become a philosophical keyword: self-proclaimed genealogies of X or Y are offered every day (where X can be democracy, modernity, spiritualism, Europe, and so on). Admittedly, the word “genealogy” doesn’t mean much more than “genesis” in most of these contexts. But even this loose understanding of the term seems to echo a philosophical tradition which grew out of Nietzsche’s Genealogy of Morals and of some influential readings of it: especially those of Deleuze and Foucault . The present research proposal aims at interrogating this tradition. To circumscribe a real tradition and not a mere intellectual fashion, the genealogical corpus must be defined as a history of explicit receptions of Nietzsche. Thus, Foucault, Judith Butler and Bernard Williams are three major genealogists in the strong sense: they have all engaged in a creative dialogue with the Genealogy of Morals, around the idea of “problematizing” our present norms and values through history . In doing so, however, they have also reinterpreted what Nietzsche initially meant by a “genealogy of morals”. Hence, it seems both needful and worthwhile to write a history of genealogical thinking in Nietzsche’s wake. This history could also help clarify what philosophical genealogy can achieve today in the fields of social and political philosophy, ethics, epistemology and gender studies.',\n",
       " \"'Mathematics is ubiquitous throughout the sciences and in everyday language and thought. Its applications across all disciplines - science, economics, engineering, computing and more - are central to the future development of a robust, creative, and driven society. The abstract character of mathematics raises difficult philosophical questions about the nature of mathematical entities (such as numbers, functions, and sets), how we have knowledge of such entities, and how they can be applied in the real world. This research project tackles such questions by integrating two perspectives in the philosophy of mathematics, viz. 'mathematical structuralism' and 'mathematical fictionalism'. Both structuralism and fictionalism capture important aspects of how many working mathematicians approach their practice. But in contemporary philosophy of mathematics, structuralism and fictionalism are widely thought of as presenting competing views of the nature of mathematics. In contrast, this project will develop a new theory of mathematical structure that unifies structuralism and fictionalism, thereby shifting the debate and promoting new and fruitful lines of research in the philosophy of mathematics and mathematical practice. Crucially, this research will be informed and supported by interdisciplinary discussions of mathematical practice with mathematicians, mathematical scientists, linguists who work on meaning and reference, and psychologists whose research focuses on mathematical cognition. Drawing on aspects of their research, this project will build a new and distinctive positive theory of the nature of mathematics. With this comprehensive theory established, the project will show how it can be deployed to make progress on long-standing problems in the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science.'\",\n",

This is especially so when it is linked with the urban question, expressing a sense of collective urgency, but also demands for urban environmental justice that are irreducible to the greening of cities.\\n\\nThis research project explores the urbanism-environment nexus historically and today. Building on a premise that “environment” is at once an ecological condition, a technological interface and a political metaphor, I examine how professional urbanists understood, designed and governed the environment. This transdisciplinary project focuses on three areas of urbanism—policy, design and research—and examines the genealogy of three interconnected fields, in which the environmental problematic has been central: urban regeneration, landscape urbanism, and urban science. This research spans the period between the 1960s and today, and analyzes the circulation of ideas, policies and practices among institutions, projects and individuals situated in the US, Europe and the former Eastern Bloc.\\n\\nWhat could environmental urbanism mean in the future? My research is underpinned by a sense of contemporary socio-environmental challenges, and aims to build bridges between historical, critical and strategic approaches in urban studies. By developing and departing from Michel Foucault’s concept of “environmentality,” this research draws attention to affinities and tensions in the urban arena between solution-focused ecological urbanism, demands for environmental equity and forms of environmental governmentality. While the concept throws into relief power relations associated with environmental action, it needs to be updated with respect to concrete ecological, technological and political dilemmas that the field of urbanism faced in the past and faces today. Could “environment” transform the urban question in ways that exceed technological solution, and become a signpost for more democratic urbanism?',\n",

       " 'This project aims to develop innovative techniques integrating advanced materials for the simultaneous seismic and energy retrofitting of the European masonry building stock. Upgrading the existing masonry EU buildings is becoming progressively more important due to: (1) their poor seismic performance during recent earthquakes (i.e. Italy, Greece) that have resulted in significant economic losses, severe injuries and loss of human lives; and (2) their low energy performance which increases significantly their energy consumption (buildings are responsible for 40% of EU energy consumption). Since replacing the existing buildings with new is prohibitively expensive and has also huge environmental and social impact, their lifetime extension requires considering both seismic and energy retrofitting. It is noted that the annual cost of repair and maintenance of existing European building stock is estimated to be about 50% of the total construction budget, currently standing at more than €300 billion. To achieve cost effectiveness, SPEctRUM explores a novel approach, proposing for the first time a hybrid structural-plus-energy retrofitting solution which combines inorganic textile-based composites with thermal insulation systems for masonry building envelopes. The effectiveness of the proposed retrofitting system will be validated experimentally and analytically. Moreover, a common approach for the buildings performance classification will be proposed, allowing to assess whether energy efficiency and disaster-resilient practices should be integrated.

Despite the important milestones achieved so far, bioprinting functional tissues surrogates has proved difficult. The biggest challenge still is the fabrication of complex (different cell types and extracellular components) structures that work, as a whole, as in the native tissue, thus being physiologically relevant. \\nThe key 3D bioprinting elements are the printer – more specifically the printing head – and the bioinks (live cells plus extracellular components). As the print head controls the deposition of the bioink, one cannot be dissociated from the other.

With our renting/leasing model and our economic 3D printing production of the robot, we are able to overcome limitations previously mentioned from existing robots on the market. Most importantly, through renting/leasing, businesses can test first-hand the real output (e.g. increased sales) our robot can bring to their businesses.\",\n",

       " 'The controlled behaviour of biological systems in response to external stimuli is ubiquitous in nature and perceived as a key requirement for the development of advanced functional materials. A good example found in nature is the so-called “sensitive plant” (Mimosa) that responds to touch by rapidly closing its leaves, as a defense mechanisms against herbivores. This quick response to touch is due to rapid water release from specialized cells located at the leaves. In attempt to mimic nature, 4D-BIOGEL project aims to combine new fully biodegradable water-filled hydrogels with additive manufacturing or 3D printing to design smart materials that can undergo a temporal change in their shape under the influence of an external stimulus, giving a 4th dimension to the previously designed 3D object. Light-sensitive structures activated by near-infrared (NIR) are especially appealing, since light can be conveniently pinpointed to the location of interest with the maximum depth of penetration and the minimum damage of tissues. To obtain NIR-sensitive hydrogels, nanoparticles capable of converting light into heat will be incorporated into the hydrogel matrix to afford small volume contraction-expansion changes on demand. This advanced technology offers great potential for the creation of sophisticated dynamic structures with high resolution that could find application not only in regenerative medicine or drug-delivery, but also in robotics or bioelectronics. \\nThe 24-month outgoing phase will take place at the University of Washington in Seattle, under the supervision of Dr. Alshakim Nelson - one of the top-class researchers in 3D and 4D printing of hydrogels.

Regarding this main objective, several edge-cutting tooling sets will be designed, validated by means of simulation and manufactured. On the one hand the development of innovative press-forming tool is required for Thermoplastic Closing Frame manufacturing, including consolidation of stiffeners and press-forming of frame caps considering variable frame thickness.

       " 'Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is a common 3D printing technology based on the extrusion of thermoplastic filaments. While it was initially used only for prototyping, it is nowadays shifting towards manufacturing of mechanical components. 4D printing is a very novel technology to produce smart materials and structures through 3D printing of shape memory materials. Due to the specific process of FDM, the material obtains a characteristic mesostructure, which can be controlled through the print process. It is well known that mechanical properties like strength and toughness of the printed material significantly differ from those of the filament material and that they depend on the mesostructure. However, a real understanding of the material behaviour and the governing phenomena is still missing. The common modelling approach is to consider it as a composite laminate. In this proposal, I show that such models cannot capture the complex behaviour of FDM materials beyond the linear elastic regime. I argue that it can only be understood by considering nonlinear effects at the mesostructure, which needs to be interpreted as a 3D structure of bonded fibres rather than an anisotropic solid. Based on these observations, I will develop a new theoretical and computational framework, where representative volume elements of the mesostructure are modelled as an arrangement of beams with adhesive bonding and are linked to the macroscale through a multiscale approach. To make such computations feasible, it will be necessary to adopt modelling simplifications and a major challenge will be to find the right level of simplification that still can capture the relevant effects. It will also require fundamental development of novel high-order/low-cost numerical methods. The results of the successful project will be a clear understanding of the mechanics of FDM materials as well as tools for the design, analysis, and optimization of FDM structural components.',\n",

This is a unique process in which a mixed waste plastic with a range of properties can fractioned into more useful recycled PE and PP grades. This will be an entirely new way to extract value from recyclate and enable it to be used in vastly more application: food packaging, films, rotomoulding, injection moulding, 3D printing.  In doing this project to optimise and pilot Polychrome, recycled plastics will be more valuable and relevant to end market applications making their use far wide spread and increasing the recyclate moving back into packaging and other high end applications.\\n\\nPolychrome uses solvents to dissolve the recyclate, before filtering to remove any pigments, additives and chemical contamination.

The key innovation is polymer “chemometers” that will be equilibrated with their surroundings and deliver information on the pollutant’s chemical activity in the environment, biota, and humans. A chemometer functions analogously to a thermometer, but instead of the temperature, it yields a measure of chemical activity. Chemical activity in turn indicates the thermodynamic potential for, e.g., partitioning, biouptake and toxicity. CHEMO-RISK aims at breaking the current paradigm in environmental risk assessment of single chemicals that disregards bioavailability, ignores mixture effects, lacks site-specificity and is difficult to extrapolate to human health.\\nThe chemometer extracts will be investigated using top-notch (a) GC and LC/Orbitrap chemical analysis to characterise the pollutant mixtures and (b) cell-based reporter gene bioassays to determine mixture effects covering baseline toxicity, specific (e.g., endocrine disruption) and reactive (e.g., genotoxicity) modes of toxic action and adaptive stress responses. Within CHEMO-RISK, the following important research questions will be tackled: (A) Which processes drive the enrichment of pollutants in aquatic biota on a thermodynamic basis? (B) How do pollutants distribute within an organism, and which effects do they elicit at the key target sites? (C) Can we apply everyday-life items such as eyeglass-nose pads to replace invasive sampling in human health risk assessment? (D) To which degree can non-target analysis of chemometer extracts explain the observed toxicity profiles across media? By combining all these research efforts, CHEMO-RISK will provide a unified risk assessment paradigm with risk-based trigger values distinguishing acceptable from unacceptable effects.',\n",

       " 'The myelin sheath is essential for neuronal function and health: myelinating glial cells speed up propagation of axonal potentials, fuel the energetic demands and regulate the ionic environment of neurons. Lesions to the myelin sheath thus result in devastating neurological disorders that include multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Myelination involves a striking expansion of the glial cell membrane that relies on an exceptional increase in protein and lipid synthesis rates.  Decades of dedicated research has uncovered a complex transcriptional program that drives this process, whereas translational control mechanisms, on the other hand, have received little attention. There is emerging evidence, enabled by modern techniques, that ribosomes, typically viewed as invariant, passive molecular machines, may instead be heterogeneous in composition, with particular ribosomal components having a ‘specialized’ regulatory capacity for preferential translation of specific mRNAs. In MyeRIBO, I propose that translation control by specialized ribosomes is a novel layer of regulation that shapes the proteome of the myelinating glial cell. I will exploit advances in cryo-EM and quantitative proteomics analyses to discover the nature and diversity of ribosomes in myelinating cells, employ genome-wide ribosome profiling to obtain mechanistic insights into selective mRNA translation by heterogeneous ribosomes, and generate genetic mouse models to determine the functional consequences of this specialization for myelination in vivo. Notably, I will study the implication of this mechanism in pathogenesis of injury-induced demyelination and diabetic neuropathy, and evaluate the targeting of specialized ribosomal components as a preclinical strategy. MyeRIBO will push further the boundaries of our current understanding of the molecular control of myelination, which could have a profound impact for understanding neural development and myelin disorders.',\n",

The impaired action of peripheral hormones on brain circuits controlling feeding and energy homeostasis, also known as 'central hormone resistance', is increasingly recognized as playing a role in the pathophysiology of these disorders. The host laboratory has raised the groundbreaking notion that tanycytes, a specific type of hypothalamic glial cells, act as 'gatekeepers' that regulate the access of blood-borne signals to the hypothalamus, and in particular, their vesicular transport into the cerebrospinal fluid, from where they enters other metabolic-hormone-sensitive regions. The overall objective of this proposal is to further develop this highly original angle by using state-of-the-art approaches to i) gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying structural changes in the tanycytic barrier in response to fluctuating concentrations of circulating glucose, and determine how these processes are altered in animal models with acquired type-2 diabetes, and ii) explore the possibility that tanycytes are involved in the shuttling of circulating glucose into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and that the tanycytic expression of the NMDA receptor plays a role in this process. This research promises to shed new light on the molecular mechanisms used by the hypothalamus to integrate key peripheral signals and coordinate energy homeostasis. The results will pave the way for the development of new treatment strategies to overcome hormone resistance in human obesity and associated metabolic syndromes.'\",\n",

       " 'The future consolidation or erosion of western democracies depends on the political perceptions, experiences and participation of ordinary citizens. Even when they disagree on the implications of their findings, previous studies stress that both attitudinal and behavioural forms of democratic linkages – political trust, political support, loyalty, formal and informal participation – have come under considerable pressure in recent decades. The QUALIDEM project offers a qualitative (re)appraisal of citizens’ (dis-)affection towards politics by relying on the core argument of the policy feedback literature: attitudes and behaviours are outcomes of past policy. It aims to explain the evolutions of democratic linkages as being shaped by public policy, and specifically by the turn to neoliberalism and supranationalisation. It aims to systematically analyse the domestic and socially differentiated effects of both of these major macro transformations to citizens’ representations and experiences of politics, as an addition to the existing emphasis on individual determinants and the existing contextual explanations of disengagement and disaffection towards politics. On the theoretical level, this project therefore aims to build bridges between scholars of public policy and students of mass politics. On the empirical level, QUALIDEM relies on the reanalysis of qualitative data – interviews and focus groups – from a diachronic and comparative perspective focusing on four Western European countries (Belgium, France, Germany and the UK) with the US serving as a counterpoint. It will renew the methodological approach to the question of ordinary citizens’ disengagement and disaffection by providing a detailed and empirically-grounded understanding of the mechanisms of production and change in democratic linkages.

The proposal puts forward an utterly original idea that leads to a novel paradigm for vehicular traffic in the era of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and is based on two combined principles.\\n\\nThe first principle is lane-free traffic, which renders the driving task for CAVs smoother and safer, as risky lane-changing manoeuvres become obsolete; increases the static and dynamic capacity of the roadway due to increased road occupancy; and mitigates congestion-triggering manoeuvres. The second principle is the nudge effect, whereby vehicles may be 'pushing' (from a distance, using sensors or communication) other vehicles in front of them; this allows for traffic flow to be freed from the anisotropy restriction, which stems from the fact that human driving is influenced only by downstream vehicles. The nudge effect may be implemented in various possible ways, so as to maximize the traffic flow efficiency, subject to safety and convenience constraints.\\n\\nTrafficFluid combines lane-free traffic with vehicle nudging to provide, for the first time since the automobile invention, the possibility to design (rather than merely describe or model) the traffic flow characteristics in an optimal way, i.e. to engineer the future CAV traffic flow as an efficient artificial fluid. To this end, the project will develop and deliver the necessary vehicle movement strategies for various motorway and urban road infrastructures, along with microscopic and macroscopic simulators and traffic management actions.\\n\\nTrafficFluid risk stems from the immense challenge of designing a new traffic system from scratch; however, we expect that the project will trigger a whole new path of international innovative research developments and testbeds that would pave the way towards a new efficient traffic system in the era of CAVs.\\n'\",\n",

For achieving and sustaining peace it is crucial to get the incentives right of all main actors in society. While subproject 1 focuses on short-run policies to stop the fighting by drying out the funding of rebel groups and hence move from war to peace, all the remaining subprojects take a medium- to long-run perspective. Subprojects 2 and 3 focus on the medium-run and assess what mix of policies can help to bridge the short- with the long-run and consolidate peace. In particular, drawing on very fine-grained data from Northern Ireland I will in subproject 2 assess the role and interplay of factors of escalation / containment of violence (“Orange marches”, “peace walls”) and factors driving democratic representation (gerrymandering and power-sharing). In subproject 3 I will perform a network and conflict analysis based on Twitter data for the Arab Spring to assess the role of civil liberties and freedom of speech in consolidating peace. Subprojects 4 to 6 study factors that are crucial for sustaining long-run peace. In subproject 4 I will build a model of how the main political institutions affect the incentives for contesting democracy on the battlefield, focusing on the role of electoral systems, coalition governments, federalism and direct democracy. Subproject 5 studies the role of education for sustaining peace. With the help of a game-theoretic model I will study the various channels through which education affects incentives for conflict, before testing the main predictions empirically. Subproject 6 focuses on another key role of modern states: Health policies. After building a theory of how health affects combat incentives, I will exploit medical innovations to assess the causal impact of health improvement on conflict incentives.',\n",
       " \"Argentinian women constitute 51,1% of the country's population but are unequally affected by poverty, discrimination and violence. Since 2015, they have increasingly protested this state of affairs via collective mobilizations on International Women’s Day and the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, by organizing to raise specific claims, such as the right to abortion or the  denunciation of rape. But how does their political agency unfold in the in-between times and spaces when collective protests are not taking place? What communicative practices do they engage then? This project investigates if and how female citizens’ everyday uses of mediated communication for justice produce democratic resolution of their claims in the context of the dataification of governance, the deficient responses of social media companies to spiraling online violence and abuse against women and other challenges to their participation in digital citizenship. The case study is emblematic of citizen-driven technopolitical efforts taking place in the Global South to fix gender inequality and other broken elements of democracy. Through a multi-method design, the study will unpack the ways in which Argentinian female citizens appropriate and interpret mediated communication in everyday technopolitics, and to which democratic effect. Results will: a) provide actionable information for female citizens to refine their day-to-day communicative practices for justice; b) advance methodological tools for monitoring strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats pertaining to their communicative agency in a changing digital environment; c) and contribute potential solutions to omissions/shortcomings in reciprocal listening to their claims from governments, corporations and other accountable organizations. The study will thus inform a future governmentality that takes responsibility for addressing citizens’ claims for justice rather than counter them.\",\n",

Tokens are small, coin like objects made either from metal or clay. They bear images and devices which can intrigue the modern day researcher with their complexity and originality. The inscriptions they carry - most often abbreviated references to little known Athenian institutions and practices - are quite as intriguing. A primary objective of the project is to reach a universally accepted definition for Athenian tokens and to provide scholarship with the first synthesis of this material. The project will also explore the roles played by tokens in two major sectors of Athenian democracy: the Assembly and the Jury Courts. Tokens are the material manifestations of practices and institutions that enabled the solidarity and cohesion of the citizen body, safeguarded legal and political equality, and were key parts in transcending knowledge and expertise. Primary research on the tokens themselves, material which is abundant but under examined and most often mislabeled, as well as library research, will chart the images on Athenian tokens by discerning categories, types and subtypes. Plotting the tokens against their find spots - most notably the sites where the affairs of the world's first democracy were run - will visualize the remarkable social and political network enabled by tokens. Tokens are unassuming objects that support community and participation in civic life, providing a model for the challenges of the modern day.\",\n",

While OPSI has found that governments are doing exciting new things that demonstrate that the potential for innovation is ever-present, the reality is that innovation practice is still inconsistent and unreliable. It is not a systematic or systemic occurrence. The projects will support governments in making their own innovation journey and build the conceptual frameworks (21st century model of innovative government) and develop the capabilities and capacities needed to accelerate learning and navigate uncertainty and high level of risks.

       " 'Nutrient-sensing by POMC neurons is a critical process to monitor the metabolic status of the organism and to coordinate adaptive neuroendocrine, behavioural and metabolic effectors of energy balance. Mitochondria, as central commanders of cellular energy production and primary sources of bioenergetic signals, are logical candidates to play a key role in metabolic control. However, a comprehensive understanding of the mitochondria as nutrient-sensors and modulators of systemic energy homeostasis is lacking. MITOSENSING hypothesizes that dedicated mitochondrial networks in POMC neurons are able to sense, integrate and respond to alterations in the nutritional milieu and engage physiological actions to maintain energy balance. Thus, defects in these mitochondrial nutrient-sensing programs in this subset of neurons underlie the development of metabolic conditions such as obesity and type-2 diabetes (T2D). To test it, we will pursue three aims: 1) to identify transcriptionally-modulated mitochondrial nutrient-sensing programs in POMC neurons; 2) to investigate whether disruption of specific nutrient-sensing programs in POMC neurons cause metabolic disorders; 3) to investigate whether the development of lifestyle-associated metabolic disorders are caused by defective mitochondrial nutrient-sensing programs in POMC neurons. By providing neuron-specific, integrative, functional and mechanistic in vivo strategies, MITOSENSING will represent a major step forward into the understanding of mitochondria as a nutrient-sensing entity, the gene programs involved and their physiological regulatory functions in the context of energy balance control. Adequate coordination of neuronal nutrient-sensing with energy balance control is critical to sustain life, and thus understanding the molecular mechanisms governing these physiological programs will have an enormous scientific impact and also potential therapeutical implications for obesity and T2D.',\n",

Diabetes management relies on blood glucose (BG) monitoring several times a day. Only 20% of the 100M people that should monitor their glucose does it periodically and correctly. This is caused, partially, by the inconveniences of available self-monitoring devices: these devices are painful, burdensome, and expensive.\\nWe have developed K'Watch Glucose, a minimally invasive glucose self-monitoring system embedded in a smartwatch. Our innovative technology measures glucose levels from extracted interstitial fluid (ISF), without painful blood-sampling and high accuracy (99%). This is possible thanks to SkinTaste®, a patented, calibration-free biosensor array that uses micro-needles (<0.7mm long) to collect and analyze chemical composition of the interstitial fluid. Thanks to its small size, our solution stays “invisible” to others, enabling monitoring of glucose levels anytime and anywhere, without anyone noticing.\\nIn the Accelerator, we will prepare K’Watch Glucose for its successful launch in the European Union and in North America by validating it clinically in our target markets, certifying it as a Class 2 medical device, by pursuing its industrialisation, preparing its reimbursement and establishing a solid commercial network of distributors, insurances and users. \\nK’Watch Glucose could have a significant impact on preventing avoidable hypoglycaemia episode and its associated complications.

The aim is to treat the formation of quark gluon plasma in relativistic nuclear collisions together with other high energy processes in a consistent QCD framework.  This project is topical now in order to fully understand the results from the maturing LHC heavy ion program. The high energy regime is characterized by a high density of gluons, whose nonlinear interactions are beyond the reach of simple perturbative calculations. High energy particles also propagate nearly on the light cone, unaccessible to Euclidean lattice calculations. The nonlinear interactions at high density lead to the phenomenon of gluon saturation. The emergence of the 'saturation scale', a semihard typical transverse momentum, enables a weak coupling expansion around a nonperturbatively large color field. This project aims to make progress both in collider phenomenology and in more conceptual aspects of nonabelian gauge field dynamics at high energy density:\\n1. Significant advances towards higher order accuracy will be made in cross section calculations for processes where a dilute probe collides with the strong color field of a high energy nucleus. \\n2. The quantum fluctuations around the strong color fields in the initial stages of a relativistic heavy ion collision will be analyzed with a new numerical method based on an explicit linearization of the equations of motion, maintaining a well defined weak coupling limit.\\n3. Initial conditions for fluid dynamical descriptions of the quark gluon plasma phase in heavy ion collisions will be obtained from a constrained QCD calculation.\\nWe propose to achieve these goals with modern analytical and numerical methods, on which the P.I. is a leading expert.

This crossover and properties of the QGP phase are important for understanding the evolution of the early universe and are being studied by major Heavy Ion Collision (HIC) experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition temperature and many QGP properties have been determined by Lattice QCD simulations. However, connecting these to experimental remnants of QGP fireballs produced at HICs is not straightforward.

The Higgs boson was the final piece of the Standard Model (SM), a theory describing elementary particles and their interactions. The current run of the LHC at higher energy aims to thoroughly explore the interactions of the Higgs boson and search for deviations from the SM predictions. A model-independent framework to organise and parametrise deviations from the SM is that of Effective Field Theory (EFT), in which higher-dimension operators modify the interactions of the SM particles. Further work is needed to consistently examine all Higgs production channels within the EFT and in the most accurate way possible, a topic which the proposed work aims to address. In particular, the applicant aims to study a class of Higgs production processes starting at leading order with one loop, the so-called loop-induced processes, including all relevant dimension-6 operators and providing accurate predictions for the differential observables. Additionally, tree-level processes that have not been explored so far will be studied to next-to-leading order in QCD.

       " \"The increasing need for new magnetic storage applications has brought to the fore new topologically stable particle-like spin configurations known as magnetic skyrmions, which appear as attractive candidates for future spintronic devices. For the efficient controllable manipulation of magnetic skyrmions, it is important to understand their dynamics, their response to external driving fields as well as their dissipation effects. Damping emerges from the coupling of the skyrmion to the environment degrees of freedom, such as electrons, magnons, or phonons, while its amplitude and form is prescribed by the microscopic details of the system. Thus, in an actual experimental setup, tuning in situ the rate at which the skyrmion dissipates is challenging. Q-Skyrmions takes up this challenge and aims to design optimal ways to manipulate skyrmion's dynamics under certain driven non-equilibrium conditions. The environment is dynamically engineered out-of-equilibrium by efficient external protocols, such as time-periodic fields, ultra-short laser pulses and thermal gradients. The interaction of the skyrmion with the reservoir degrees of freedom, gives rise to dissipation and thermal random forces that incorporate the environment’s dynamical activity and will result in a tunable dissipation. By merging concepts from the general area of quantum driven dissipative systems and exploring several features of out-of-equilibrium dynamics, the action investigates how the propagation of topological particles can be dynamically controlled by experimentally relevant protocols. In addition, the action Q-Skyrmions investigates quantum effects for atomic-scale skyrmions in magnetic insulators, ideal candidates to exhibit quantum mechanical behavior at a mesoscopic scale.

However, the open sea is a very aggressive environment with may largely affect the maintenance costs of the installations and therefore the overall cost of offshore energy generation. The owners of offshore assets are well aware of that and are paying a steep price. A massive amount of steel goes into those assets, and all this metal is subject to degradation, which explains why corrosion accounts for approximately 60% of offshore maintenance cost. Preventive maintenance is not just expensive but also reduces the operating life of the assets. Despite the convenient immunity to corrosion of Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP), the use of those materials for large marine structures is limited to secondary components.\\n \\nThe main objective of the FIBREGY project is to enable the extensive use of FRP materials in the structure of the next generation of large Renewable Energy Offshore Platforms (REOPs) by overcoming the above mentioned challenges. In order to achieve this objective, the project will develop, qualify and audit innovative FRP materials for offshore applications, elaborate new design procedures and guidelines, generate efficient production, inspection and monitoring methodologies, and validate and demonstrate advanced software analysis tools. Clear performance indicators will be designed and applied in the evaluation of two existing REOPs concepts to be re-engineered in FRP in the project. Finally, the different technologies generated in FIBREGY will be demonstrated by using advanced simulation techniques and building a real-scale prototype to validate the materials, tools, solutions, procedures and guidelines to be developed in FIBREGY.',\n",

These are matters that the University of Life Sciences (Eesti Maaülikool, EMU) has been dealing with for long from various angles and perspectives. However, to realise the full potential of EMU in this domain, structural changes are needed to bring various related competences under a unified umbrella as well as to cover several gaps hindering further development. Therefore, the main objective of the current project is to establish a new ERA Chair for Food (By-) Products Valorisation Technologies (VALORTECH), and recruit a top level researcher/research manager (ERA Chair holder) to lead this interdisciplinary, inter-unit entity, formed based on a joint effort by the Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences and the Institute of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences of EMU. The new Chair is expected to considerably improve the research and innovation performance of EMU and conduct forefront research that would create significant benefits for both Estonia, Europe and beyond.\\nEfficient dissemination and exploitation of research results is an issue of key importance in the context of the ERA Chair´s action plan. In addition to targeting the international research community and providing input to policy development, facilitating knowledge transfer to industry is at particular focus.

       " 'The pressure, radiation, and ionization from the warm (UV emitting) and hot (X-ray emitting) gas has a significant impact on the cold, star-forming interstellar medium. We propose to carry out a comprehensive 3D study of the turbulent, multi-phase ISM in different environments that includes, for the first time, a proper treatment of UV and X-ray emission from stellar (primary) sources and extended (secondary) sources like cooling shock fronts and evaporating clouds. We do this by means of massively parallel, high-resolution 3D simulations that capture the complex interplay of gravity, magnetic fields, feedback from massive stars (ionizing radiation, radiation pressure, stellar winds, supernovae), heating and cooling including X-rays and cosmic rays, and chemistry. We are developing a novel, original and highly efficient method to accurately treat the transfer of radiation from multiple point and extended sources in the 3D simulations. Radiation and chemistry will be coupled to achieve self-consistent heating, cooling, and ionization rates. Moreover, accurate synthetic observations covering the large dynamic range from X-rays down to radio emission will be generated to set the results in the proper observational context. This will enable us to address the key science questions: How efficient is stellar feedback in different environments and which feedback process is dominant? What is the precise role of UV radiation and X-rays, also from secondary sources? Are the observations following the key dynamical players? How do we best interpret ISM observations from ALMA, SKA, or ATHENA? How do we assist in designing future observations? With the resources requested here we will perform the most self-consistent theoretical study of the multi-phase ISM so far, thus building up a leading group for ISM research in Europe. To stimulate worldwide scientific activities and interactions we will make all data available to the community through an open-access web interface.',\n",

With a global amount of 14.94 M babies born prematurely, PTB is the leading cause of neonatal and infant mortality globally, and those who survive often have breathing problems, cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities and other lifelong problems. On top of the associated suffering and societal long-term consequences, PTB is associated with more than €50,000 in healthcare costs per premature baby, which translates into total yearly costs for the healthcare system of €20 billion in Europe, and €23 billion in USA. \\nPregnolia is a unique diagnostic device to determine the risk of PTB based on the measurements of cervical tissue stiffness. Our patented device has twice the sensitivity of the current “gold standard” (ultrasounds), it is simple, safe, and easy to use and to integrate into routine gynaecological consultations. With our solution, the majority of women, 80% out of 100% at risk, can be treated to prevent premature birth. \\nThis phase 2 project has been defined to upgrade Pregnolia’s prototype based on our Feasibility Study outcomes, which will allow us to fulfil our clinical and commercial goals by delivering an innovative and cost-effective diagnostic device for addressing the unmet need of PTB, while sustaining a viable commercial model. Pregnolia will achieve net revenues of ~€74 M, net profits of ~€30 M and, considering the investment of €8.8M, a ROI of ~7 euro per euro invested at year 5.

       " 'Birth control pills have been on the market for almost 60 years now and are used by almost 200 million women worldwide. Particularly, the use of birth control pills increases among adolescents. However, the effects of birth control pills on the brain have widely been ignored. It was my own research that found the first indication that birth control pills affect female brain structure and masculinize female brain function. Furthermore, I recently obtained evidence that these changes are strongly dependent on the type of synthetic hormone contained in birth control pills and might affect some brain areas, like the hippocampus, beyond the duration of contraceptive treatment. This poses the question, whether effects of birth control pills on the brain are fully reversible after women stop taking the pill, especially if pill use occurs during sensitive periods of brain development, like in adolescents. \\nPrevious studies suffer from small sample sizes and insufficient study designs. Importantly, they compare women on birth control pills to naturally cycling women (cross-sectional designs) rather than following the same women from before she starts taking the pill through the first months of her pill use and vice versa (longitudinal designs). Accordingly they may be confounded by sampling bias.\\nTherefore the general aims of this proposal are (A) to study the effects of birth control pills on the brain – for the first time – systematically in a longitudinal design, and (B) to address whether the effects of birth control pills on the brain are fully reversible. I seek to link changes in the brain to changes in behaviour, and address whether different types of pills cause different effects. Most importantly, a specific focus will lie on teen use of birth control pills. In order to address these questions, this project will employ a multi-modal imaging design, following several groups of pill users over multiple time-points before, during and after contraceptive treatment.',\n",
       " 'Each year over two million babies are born very preterm (VP; <32 weeks’ gestational age) and/or with very low birthweight (VLBW; <1500g) worldwide. Despite improved neonatal care, these children remain at high risk for developmental problems later in life. The most common adverse outcomes are social, emotional and attention problems which can impact on a child’s lifelong health and wellbeing. It is therefore critical to understand trajectories of social, emotional and attention problems after VP/VLBW birth to target intervention and improve outcomes across the lifespan. However, although a wealth of data has been collected, there is a paucity of research investigating trajectories of social, emotional and attention development in this population. This project will utilise data from 28 international birth cohort studies, comprising data from an unrivalled sample of 7,053 VP/VLBW participants, the investigators of which have already agreed to data sharing. Novel, innovative statistical techniques will be applied to harmonise different measures of social, emotional and attention problems producing a unique dataset that will allow me to use complex multilevel and longitudinal growth modelling to analyse trajectories from birth to adolescence. The results will advance theoretical understanding of the developmental pathways to social, emotional and attention problems and will have international impact informing the development of clinical guidelines for follow-up care, multidisciplinary intervention, parental counselling and educational policy and planning. The ultimate aim of my proposed research is to improve lifelong outcomes for the growing population of children born very preterm. The training and experience I will gain from working with leading multidisciplinary teams in this field of research will provide me with a unique opportunity to develop myself as an independent academic with the skills, collaborations and expertise needed to become a future research leader.',\n",
       " 'During the last decades, Spain has experienced not only an strong decrease on its fertility levels but also a significant delay in its timing to childbearing, so much so that it has been considered one of the countries with the lowest-low and latest-late fertility in the world. This research aims to better understand the reasons behind young adults’ behaviors in family dynamics in a moment where it is possible to approach the impact of the economic crisis from different dimensions of the analysis. An extended scientific literature can be found about family formation dynamics and fertility, especially for European countries and mainly using a quantitative perspective. This mainly qualitative project proposes an innovative methodology to analyze the Spanish case from a three different perspectives of analysis: a cross-country comparison (five countries in 2012), an historical comparison (Spain 1985 vs. 2012) and a longitudinal comparison (Spain, same sample in 2012 and 2017). Furthermore, mixed methods will be applied considering the contextualization of qualitative data with quantitative data from census and surveys as complementary approaches; and the application of quantitative analysis to qualitative data. Main data from Spain in 2012 comes directly from the words of young adults in three different moments of their family formation decisions: i) to start a stable relationship; ii) to become parents; and iii) to expand the family after the first child. Main data consists of eighty (80) in-depth personal interviews already carried out to young adults between 24 and 35 years old, living in the Madrid and Barcelona metropolitan areas, that will be compared with an identical sample in the US, Sweden, Japan and Korea. Historical data comes from an existing comparable study from middle 80’s in Spain and longitudinal data will be obtained after re-interview in 2017 the same sample interviewed in 2012 for Spain.',\n",
       " 'The education and training of the Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) workforce is of prime importance as it equips practitioners with the knowledge, skills and attitudinal competences needed to work with children. Training supports them in creating quality environments for children to enhance the quality of provision and subsequent child outcomes. The research is timely with the increased interest in the benefits of quality ECEC for supporting the holistic development of children, but with a need to understand more about the role of the workforce in this. Whilst qualifications have been established as important for the quality of ECEC, little is known about the nature of the qualifications and the role that they play in developing the knowledge, skills and attitudinal competences needed to best enhance the quality of ECEC provision. The research will focus on ECEC qualification requirements, structure, content and characteristics across Europe. The project will analyse (via secondary data) the qualification requirements across Europe, the composition of the qualifications and their relationship to child outcomes. This macro level analysis will be supported by a detailed investigation (via empirical research) into the delivery of qualifications and the role they play in developing the knowledge, skills and attitudinal competences appropriate to the context. The detailed investigation of qualifications will consider the formulation, delivery, experiences and application of ECEC higher education training in the host’s institution, selected for its expertise in training kindergarten pedagogues in Hungary. ECEC in Hungary is under explored, whilst also offering an interesting case to study due to how its history, market composition and quantity of provision contrast with those experienced by the Fellow in the UK.

       " 'The project is a comparative study of adolescent digital literacy and digital media use, using a mixed qualitative approach with an emphasis on ethnography. The rapid increase in children’s engagement with digital technologies raises questions regarding their potential impact on wellbeing. However, the data currently available to us as to this impact are largely inconclusive. This is partially due to the fact that most studies rely on quantitative measures that offer little insight into the actual content consumed, or the contexts within which engagement with media takes place. The study addresses these limitations by introducing the use of ethnographic methods to investigate the broader relational contexts within which teens’ interaction with digital media takes shape. Specifically, it investigates the relationship between two factors found to potentially impact teen wellbeing while using digital media: digital literacy, and the manners in which digital media is integrated into family life. Differences in digital literacy and family integration patterns are examined across both gender and socioeconomic divides, as well as between children who mostly consume digital media, and those who also produce digital media artifacts and contents through active engagements in spaces such as Fabrication Labs or Makerspaces. By taking a qualitative, holistic and longitudinal approach, the study aims to identify mechanisms involved in facilitating a fruitful integration of digital media into children’s lives, and to generate data needed for the development of strategies and guidelines to aid teens, parents and educators promote digital media engagement in manners that would enhance teen wellbeing.',\n",

Nevertheless, beyond the SM theories offer a rich phenomenology and exciting prospects for the discovery of New Physics in the Higgs sector. This project aims to observe physics beyond the SM in   the Higgs boson sector through the search for Higgs boson, h pairs in the hh->γγb bbar channel, which benefits from the large h-> b bbar branching ratio, efficient diphoton trigger, low backgrounds and excellent diphoton invariant mass resolution.  Both the resonant and non-resonant production are considered. To this end, the proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at  the Large Hadron Collider over the next two years, will be used and are expected to amount to 70/fb. The proposal to search for anomalous Higgs boson production and for heavy resonant  states decaying to hh is original, and innovative methods in all aspects of the project will be employed. The results of the project, which will provide new information on the h self-couplings and the production of new resonances decaying to hh, will be interpreted within various theoretical frameworks, with emphasis in two Higgs-doublet models.',\n",

The A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE), the devoted experiment to investigate heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, is going through a substantial upgrade in 2019 and 2020 which is crucial to elucidate the properties of QGP by allowing the measurement of challenging probes like low pT heavy-flavor particles and quarkonium states and their coupling with the medium. HeavyQGP has the following scientific objectives: 1) perform analysis of ALICE data for quarkonia and beauty production; 2) ensure the quality of RUN3 ALICE data at forward geometries; 3) explore novel applications for the ALPIDE sensor; 4) operate the Muon Forward Tracker; 5) apply Open Science concepts at ALICE. HeavyQGP explores an innovative combination of expertise provided by the fellow (CPU architecture, computational physics, and nuclear instrumentation) and by the hosting institution (central involvement in ALICE Experiment and its upgrade) which improves the career prospects of the researcher while also supplying the host institution with key competences to initiate a high performance computing group on its premises and to fulfill its commitment to the ALICE upgrade program.

       " 'The Standard Model (SM) is widely accepted to be an approximation of a more complete theory of nature, but laboratory tests have failed to identify a conclusive deviation from its precise predictions. In the SM two of the four fundamental forces of nature, namely the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, are governed by three fundamental parameters. These parameters are precisely fixed by experimental determinations of the Z boson mass, the fine structure constant, and the Fermi constant. Other parameters are subsequently predictable and can therefore be confronted with experimental data, potentially exposing physics effects beyond the SM. Of notable importance are the W boson mass and the weak-mixing angle since these two parameters are not yet measured as precisely as they are predicted. A delicate feature of the SM, which could easily be perturbed by new physics, is the universality between the coupling strengths of the three known lepton generations to the gauge bosons. There is an intriguing set of beauty hadron measurements which suggest a violation of lepton universality, with a particularly large effect in the third generation. While inconclusive at this stage these results intensify the demand for a test of a potentially related anomaly in the partial decay width of the W boson to third generation leptons. Qualitatively new ideas are needed to tackle these scientific problems.  LHCb is the first experiment of its kind, as a small-angle spectrometer detector at a hadron collider, and the SPEAR project is well timed to analyse existing data from LHCb and the full dataset from the first running period with the LHCb upgrade. The SPEAR project sets ambitious goals of (i) measuring the W mass for the first time with a small-angle spectrometer (ii), making the first weak mixing angle determination at a hadron collider that matches the precision of electron-positron colliders, and (iii) resolving the long-standing W boson lepton universality puzzle.',\n",

       " \"'Project FLOWSPA (Floating Offshore Wind Support Platform Assembly) will demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative floating offshore wind foundation structure “Starfloat” that combines “spar” technology with “semi-submersible” technology to provide a compact and cost effective low motion platform for supporting large capacity wind turbines at deep-water offshore wind farm sites. Energy analysts have predicted that, if a viable and cost effective technology can be delivered, the deep-water offshore wind market in Europe could meet 50% of Europe’s electricity requirement by 2050. Unlike competitor technologies the simple scalable 'Starfloat' is designed for construction at existing shipbuilding facilities with restricted water depth thus opening up construction opportunities for European shipyards that are currently in decline. The innovative floating foundation design and assembly process takes significant cost out of the CAPEX of deep water floating offshore wind projects and removes the need for risky offshore marine operations. 'Starfloat' therefore has the potential to be disruptive to the current perceived limitations of the offshore wind industry by bring floating offshore wind into the same levelised cost of energy (LCOE) as fixed foundation offshore wind. This will allow the project financing of deeper water wind farm sites, where the wind resource is stronger and more reliable, to be exploited using relatively low risk technology with the end result of reducing carbon emissions and reduced dependency for Europe on imported fuels. It also has the benefit of bringing steel fabrication work to declining shipyards and assembly work to deep-water offshore construction sites that are currently seeing a sharp decline in activity with the fall in the oil price and the collapse of the new shipbuilding market.'\",\n",

       " 'Temperature Reconstruction in Europe using cosmogenic Noble Gas Observations (TRENGO). I propose to reconstruct temperatures during the Late Quaternary (from within the last glacial cycle (LGC) to the present) using observations of cosmogenic noble gases in bedrock depth profiles at two key sites in Europe: the southernmost British Isles, and the southern coast of Spain. These two sites span the range of latitudes in Europe that were ice free during the LGC; temperature reconstructions at these sites will therefore capture endmembers of climate along the Atlantic margin of Europe during the LGC and deglaciation. Constraints on past climate conditions in these two regions from conventional proxies like pollen are largely restricted to the Holocene and ubiquitously mired by human influence. The temperature reconstructions proposed here could therefore provide unprecedented insight into long term climate dynamics over western Europe. I pioneered the use of cosmogenic noble gas observations for temperature reconstruction during my PhD and am thus uniquely suited to pursue this work. The Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre within the University of Glasgow is one of the few institutions on Earth with the analytical capability and expertise to allow me to achieve the research aims of this proposal in full, and I will acquire new technical skills in cosmogenic radionuclide analysis essential to my future career.

This snapshot approach, however, ignores the reconstructive and dynamic nature of the retrieval process, necessarily limiting our understanding of human memory. The vision behind STREAM is to advance the field beyond its current state of the art by mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of mnemonic reconstruction in the human brain. The research programme contains three work packages that support this vision at multiple levels of investigation, from combined electrophysiological and hemodynamic activity down to neuronal assembly firing patterns in the human hippocampus. These techniques are used in combination with paradigms that decompose memories into their constituent elements, and track the neural representations of these elements as they unfold in time and space when an event is reconstructed from memory. So far, it has been difficult to integrate information obtained by these various recording techniques. STREAM will use an innovative representational mapping approach that combines spatiotemporal information at the level of an individual's neural representational architecture. This approach enables us to directly map memory patterns emerging at a given time point onto a given brain region. If successful, STREAM will reveal the first comprehensive spatiotemporal map of memory retrieval, with the potential to cause a major shift in the field away from the currently dominant snapshot paradigm towards a time-resolved, reconstructive view of human memory.'\",\n",
       " 'The proposal focusses on investigating the incorporation of microstructural aspects of soil fabric into an existing coupled mechanical and retention framework for saturated and unsaturated soils. Particular emphasis will be given to two challenging patterns of microstructural behaviour: (1) Soils exhibiting a highly directional-dependent response, as a consequence of a particular orientation of their internal structure (anisotropic behaviour); (2) Soils exhibiting large swelling deformations on wetting, as a consequence of the presence in the soil of highly expansive clay minerals (expansive behaviour). Both of these aspects are intimately related to the internal clay fabric (micro-level) and an improved understanding of the influences that the microstructural fraction has on the global soil response (macro-level) is central to the development of a novel constitutive model capable to represent comprehensively these advanced features of soil behaviour. Full implementation of such constitutive model into a finite element formulation will provide a unique computational tool from where practitioners and researchers will be able to assess, in a unified manner, simple and advanced geotechnical engineering applications involving both saturated and unsaturated soil behaviour. Effectively, the use of a more reliable material representation in geotechnical designs, by means of the implemented model, will facilitate a safer construction and serviceability of civil infrastructures supported on the ground while potentially reducing associated costs.',\n",
       " 'Patterns of space use by animals appear to be immensely diverse. However, recent work has suggested that they can all emerge from the interplay between only four drivers: cognitive abilities, movement constraints, social behaviour, and environmental conditions. Despite the considerable implications of space use patterns for ecological processes (e.g. nutrient fluxes, disease dynamics, invasions, extinctions), we still lack a unified theory of the causal links between the observed breadth of space use patterns and their drivers. This is mainly because there is little integration between field studies of the different types of movement (e.g. territoriality, nomadism, migration), and an uncomfortable divide between mechanistic movement models and data.\\nIn this project, I will combine for the first time individual-based modelling and recent advances in statistical analysis applied on a unique portfolio of tracking data comprising three ungulate, two seabird, and one fish species. This approach will enable me to 1) develop a universal individual-based model of animal movement that can generate all existing types of space use patterns, 2) infer what biological  mechanisms and parameters are implied by the patterns observed in nature, and 3) introduce a new methodology to the movement ecology research field. I will use this new integrative framework to specifically investigate four hypotheses on the drivers of site fidelity (residency), spatial segregation, migration and aggregation.\\nThis project will not only greatly advance our understanding of the determinants of space use patterns, but will also be a crucial precursor to predicting how complex natural and anthropogenic environmental changes may impact animal populations.',\n",
       " 'Cancers are the leading cause of death in the developed world, with populations facing a 30% chance of developing the disease by the age of 75. As part of a concerted effort to open up new treatments and improve patients’ experiences with existing ones, the concept of drug delivery – using non-toxic carriers to transport medicines directly to the location of disease – has emerged. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), porous materials comprised of organic linkers and metal joints, show considerable promise as drug delivery vectors due to their high storage capacities, amenability to functionalization and the ability to prepare entirely non-toxic nanoparticulate derivatives. This proposal will use the PI’s expertise in advanced MOF synthetic methods to facilitate dramatic technological breakthroughs through unprecedented control of MOF self-assembly and surface chemistry. Management of MOF surface chemistry will allow installation of stimuli responsive release mechanisms and offer control over the trapping and release of cargo within MOFs, ensuring drugs are released only at the site of disease in the body. Surface incorporation of sophisticated biotargeting units such as peptides and aptamers will facilitate selective uptake of the MOFs by diseased tissues only. Rapid clean microwave syntheses will allow metal radionuclides to be incorporated for PET imaging, offering a novel alternative to traditional chelates. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo testing will ensure that this multidisciplinary streamlining of materials, supramolecular and medicinal chemistries with the biosciences will generate highly efficient theranostic devices, offering more efficient, targeted drug delivery to improve treatment efficiency, mitigate side effects and open up new therapeutic avenues such as siRNA delivery. The fundamental advances required to generate these novel materials will also impact across the many applications of MOFs, from molecular storage and separations to catalysis.',\n",

       " 'The problem this project addresses is that operative modes for interpreting the Greek New Testament (NT) rely upon critical editions, not manuscripts. NT editions are scholarly abstractions that focus on reconstructing an “original” text, and that fail to account for a rich manuscript tradition that preserves evidence for key disciplinary questions. Instead of asking how manuscripts help reconstruct a text, this project examines what manuscripts say about the ways the NT was interpreted by the communities that produced them. This is accomplished by comprehensively analysing the forms and wordings of the title preserved in all non-lectionary NT manuscripts (c. 3500). Titles are malleable paratexts that provide a substantive vector to rethink approaches to the NT by seriously considering contexts of production and interpretation ranging from 2rd century Egypt to modern Mt. Athos, moving beyond the 1st century Roman world. Titles demonstrate that material and paratextual variance in form and design are constitutive aspects of the NT. Adopting New Philology as a methodology, the project critiques dominant approaches by taking each manuscript seriously as evidence for specific reading events, using titles as primary evidence. Titular analysis informs a range of topics, including authorship, locales of production, contexts of use, bibliography, and literary interpretation. The NT is best understood as an omnibus of manuscripts that constitute specific reading events, reflecting the interpretations of the communities that used them. The NT has never been a single reconstructed text, but a collection of texts in specific material and paratextual contexts. Despite the value inherent in the manuscripts, scholarship has focused almost exclusively on the NT’s original context of composition. Resisting this trend, the project argues that titles are a rich resource for mapping the interpretation of the NT in contexts overlooked by critical scholarship: its own manuscript matrix.',\n",
       " 'The brain’s multisensory faculty provides considerable benefits for perception, as the adaptive weighting of multiple inputs increases perceptual reliability and flexibility. However, failure of this process results in an impoverished percept, and links to perceptual deficits that occur along our life span and in disorders such as Autism. While the brain efficiently handles multiple sensory inputs, we still have a limited understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms. To advance our knowledge of how the brain processes its environment I propose a pioneering agenda that departs from previous descriptive work by linking the underlying brain mechanisms with specific multisensory computations and perception.\\n\\nPrecisely, I propose a programme that combines computational models of multisensory interactions with high-density neuroimaging and perceptual tasks. This interdisciplinary research builds on my pioneering multisensory work but will provide a qualitatively new and principled understanding of the neural processes that implement the well-known perceptual benefits of multisensory information.\\n\\nThe proposed programme advances our knowledge by addressing the following timely questions: What are the neural processes transforming multiple sensory inputs to a unified representation guiding behaviour? How does the brain control the dynamic weighting of multiple inputs and assigns these to either a single or multiple causes? Which perceptual and neural processes are affected in the multisensory deficits seen in autistic individuals or the elderly?\\n\\nThis agenda, by its innovative methods and deliverables, will offer a principled and comprehensive understanding of how the brain handles and merges multiple sensory inputs, and provides a framework for addressing continuing and pressing problems associated with multisensory processing deficits seen in cognitive disorders and during our life span.',\n",
       " 'By 1603 the political power of the Gaelic world, or Gáidhealtachd, had been broken in the face of the recently created British state. Though certain Gaelic dynasties (i.e., the Campbells and O’Briens) actively worked with the state, little research has been undertaken on how dynasties such as the O’Donnells and O’Neills possessed the capacity not only to resist but also to threaten this process of state formation throughout the 16th century. Using a series of case studies and drawing upon a broad base of primary material, this project explores the political and military development of the Gáidhealtachd during two key phases of Anglo-Scottish relations. The first section investigates how certain Gaelic lords manipulated the course of Anglo-Scottish hostilities from 1513-59 in order to enhance their position within ‘British’ politics. The second section explores how the Gaelic lords reacted to the development of Anglo-Scottish peace and amity from 1560-94. The main objective of this project is therefore to uncover the basis for the strong level of Gaelic political and military resilience within ‘British’ politics throughout the 16th century and how significant a factor this was in contributing to the outbreak of the Nine Years War (1594-1603). This is an interdisciplinary project, involving Gaelic, English, Scottish, and Latin historical material as well as elements of literature and archaeology. The project will be strengthened by the experienced interdisciplinary research team at the University of Glasgow and will involve both the transfer of knowledge to the host institution and the training of the researcher in new competences.  Ultimately, this project will make a major intervention in the history of Early Modern Ireland and Britain and will result in a series of high-impact publications. The proposal also entails a secondment to BBC Scotland and a detailed public engagement strategy aimed at changing public perceptions of 16th century Ireland and Britain.',\n",
       " 'Episodic memory refers to the fascinating human ability to remember past events in a highly associative and information rich way. But how are these memories coded in human brains? Any mechanism accounting for episodic memory must accomplish at least two functions: to build novel associations, and to represent the information constituting the memory. Neural oscillations, regulating the synchrony of neural assemblies, are ideally suited to accomplish these two functions, but in opposing ways. On the one hand, neurophysiological work suggests that increased synchrony strengthens synaptic connections and thus forms the basis for associative memory. Neurocomputational work, on the other hand, suggests that decreased synchrony is necessary to flexibly express information rich patterns in a neural assembly. Therefore, a conundrum exists as to how oscillations code episodic memory. The aim of this project is to propose and test a new framework that has the potential to reconcile this conflict. The central idea is that synchronization and desynchronization cooperatively code episodic memories, with synchronized activity in the hippocampus in the theta (~4 Hz) and gamma (~ 40-60 Hz) frequency range mediating the building of associations, and neocortical desynchronization in the alpha (~10 Hz) and beta (~15 Hz) frequency range mediating the representation of mnemonic information. Importantly the two modules, with their respective synchronous/asynchronous behaviours, must interact during the formation and retrieval of episodic memories, but how and whether this is the case remains untested to date.  I will test these fundamental questions using a multidisciplinary and multi-method approach, including human single cell recordings, neuroimaging, brain stimulation, and computational modelling. The results from these experiments have the potential to reveal the neural code that human episodic memory is based on, which is still one of the biggest mysteries of the human mind.',\n",
       " 'Mosquitoes transmit several medically and economically important ARthropod-BOrne (arbo)viruses to mammals (including humans), such as dengue virus and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Unlike infection in their mammalian host, infection in their arthropod vector is apathogenic and persistent due to the interplay between the virus and the innate immune responses. The main antiviral mechanism in mosquitoes is the sequence specific RNA break down mechanism- RNA interference (RNAi), specifically the 21 nucleotide (nt) long small interfering (si)RNAs are considered to play a key role; however, siRNAs are not likely to be essential for the establishment of persistent viral infection. Recently small RNA molecules derived from different pathway have been reported to have an antiviral role in aedine mosquitoes and derived cell lines: PIWI interacting (pi)RNAs (24-29 nt). Persistent infection ensures that mosquitoes remain infectious and if piRNAs control this process, they could play a key part in regulating subsequent arbovirus transmission to humans. Little is known about the piRNA pathway in mosquitoes and even less about its interaction with arbovirus infections. Most of the work has focused on the identification and analysis of (viral specific) small RNAs (siRNA and piRNAs) in infected mosquitoes, but little on the proteins and the protein-RNA interactions involved in these processes.\\nThe proposed research project will use a multidisciplinary approach that involves molecular virology with CHIKV, quantitative proteomics, RNA sequencing and knock down experiments in Aedes aegypti derived cells and mosquitoes to comprehensively understand for the first time the piRNA pathway, its involvement and importance to regulate arbovirus infections in aedine mosquitoes. The findings will extend our knowledge on the interactions between arboviruses and their mosquito vector and generate information that could be used in novel disease-spread control strategies.',\n",
       " 'In this research project we will perform the first search for a promising new type of gravitational-wave signal from neutron stars: medium-duration transients (MDTs). We will use data of unprecedented sensitivity from the new detectors Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. A successful detection will provide a novel test of gravity and unique insights into the structure of neutron stars.\\nGravitational waves (GWs) were predicted by Einstein a century ago, but are extremely hard to detect. Their first direct observation will herald the start of a new era in astronomy but requires specialised searches to extract the full astrophysical information about each source. Much effort already goes into the search for continuous waves (CWs) emitted by rotating neutron stars (NSs) with non-axisymmetric deformations, which should be observable over many years. Only very weak CWs are expected, but NSs can also emit relatively strong transient GWs on much shorter timescales. In this fellowship we will develop and implement the first practical search for signals spanning these extremes, bridging the gap between continuous and transient phenomena.\\nBased on an explicit CW-like signal model, limited in duration, and on a Bayesian model selection approach, we will first construct an optimal detection method for medium-duration transient (MDT) signals taking into account astrophysical priors on transient GW emission from rotating NSs. Second, we will use synergies with established CW data-analysis methods to guarantee an efficient implementation and build on previous experience to account for complex detector noise properties. We will then apply these newly-developed methods to the best advanced-detector data available. This novel CW-based transient search will be the first to provide the ability to detect NSs as MDT sources, to estimate their astrophysical parameters with high precision, and to infer their internal properties which are inaccessible through other observational methods.',\n",
       " 'I propose to adopt a novel closed-loop brain stimulation (cl-BSDS) approach to test the possibility to proactively induce optimal brain state (attention enhancement) at time t\\\\1 knowing the brain activity-behaviour relation at time t (post-conflict adjustments). The idea to use cognitive conflict to trigger attention adjustments might appear as a paradox; however behavioural data suggest that after the experience of cognitive conflict (i.e. when competing responses must be overcome) performance is better. Since the loop between cognitive conflict and attention adjustment seems to be a natural mechanisms used by the brain for flexible behaviour, we suggest to test the specific hypothesis that post conflict attention adjustments are implemented in a preparatory way from one trial to the next (WP1) and to capitalize on this mechanism to test, in real-time, to what extend the frontal-parietal interactions lend themselves to (a) implement a self-regulative brain state, with (b) potential impact on participants’ performance (WP2). This approach will be an innovative way to investigate on-line brain functions (cl-BSDS), taking into account the value of brain oscillations in encoding and determining behaviour, and generating new testable hypotheses in the field of cognitive control. Ctrl Code will provide the proof-of concept for optimizing self-regulative brain functions (conflict/attention loop) in order to develop person-centred solutions for attention boosting non-invasively. It will not need active training (vs. neuro-feedback), thus overcoming one of the strongest limitations of standard treatments, since it will capitalize on a natural context (post-conflict attention adjustments) spontaneously generated by the brain.',\n",
       " 'Training and experience can lead to long-lasting improvements in our ability to make decisions based on either ambiguous sensory or probabilistic information (e.g. learning to diagnose a noisy x-ray image or betting on the stock market). These two processes are referred to as perceptual and probabilistic/reward learning, respectively. Despite considerable efforts to uncover the neural systems involved in these processes, perceptual and reward learning have largely been studied in separate lines of research using divergent learning mechanisms. The primary aim of this proposal is to develop a unified framework for integrating these lines of research and understand the extent to which they share a common computational and neurobiological basis. Specifically, we will test the proposition that both the perceptual and reward systems could be understood in a common framework of “reward maximization”, whereby a domain-general reinforcement-guided learning mechanism – based on separate prediction error representations – facilitates future actions and adaptive behavior. To offer a comprehensive spatiotemporal characterization of the relevant networks and their computational principles we will adopt a state-of-the-art multimodal neuroimaging approach to fuse simultaneously-acquired EEG and fMRI data, via machine-learning-inspired multivariate single-trial analysis techniques and computational modelling. The project’s ultimate goal is to empower a level of neuronal and mechanistic understanding that extends beyond what could be inferred with each of these modalities in isolation. We will achieve this goal by exploiting endogenous trial-by-trial electrophysiological variability to build parametric fMRI predictors that can offer additional explanatory power than what can already be achieved by stimulus- or behaviorally-derived predictors, allowing us to go over and beyond what has been reported previously in the literature.',\n",
       " 'Myocardial infarction (MI) is a key risk factor for sudden cardiac death, a leading global cause of mortality. Understanding how altered tissue architecture in MI influences cardiac electrical conduction is crucial to develop therapies which treat abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) clinically. Optical measurement of transmembrane voltage in cardiac muscle is a versatile, non-invasive tool to investigate myocardial conduction. However, the current techniques of wide-field and multiphoton imaging have individual limitations restricting their ability to study key features of conduction in a 3D framework. Furthermore, optogenetics cannot be easily implemented in imaging platforms due to spectral overlap with the activation of light-gated ion channels such as channelrhodopsin. Combining all 3 techniques will provide a platform to study electrical conduction within mammalian myocardium in a 3D context and will be capable of quantifying effects introduced by tissue heterogeneity such as vasculature and scar tissue. \\nThe proposed project combines development of novel imaging technology with applied cardio-(patho)-physiology to study cardiac conduction at tissue interfaces in intact hearts with an innovative correlative approach. A new all-optical platform will be developed to simultaneously measure and stimulate cardiac activity, with the capability for real-time stimulation using custom optical patterns. Conduction will be mapped experimentally across structurally distinct regions and depths in healthy and MI hearts. This data will be correlated with underlying cytoarchitecture in the same hearts by employing tissue clearing in combination with novel light-sheet microscopy for imaging of structurally intact whole organs. This work will realise a new platform to study conduction in 3D microstructural context and deliver proof-of-concept data to address key questions concerning electrical behaviour in healthy and diseased hearts.',\n",

It is among the most thriving areas in contemporary philosophy. \\n\\tHowever, there is little agreement concerning the best methodological approach to social epistemological issues. Individualism puts the individual first; it asks: ‘What are the epistemic responsibilities of individuals in social settings?’ Its main weakness is that it is too demanding to be empirically plausible: according to Individualism, the individual has to do most of the work in separating reliable from unreliable sources. In contrast, Socialism puts the social factor first; it asks: ‘How does the social environment need to be for individuals to acquire justified beliefs?’ On this view, individuals need to do more or less epistemic work, depending on the social norms in force at the context. Socialism is too permissive, in that it licences socially accepted but epistemically irresponsible behaviour.\\n\\tKNOWLEDGELAB develops a novel methodology for social epistemology, one that puts knowledge first; it starts with the function of social epistemic interactions, i.e. that of generating knowledge. It asks: ‘How should we proceed in social epistemic interactions in order to generate knowledge?’ KNOWLEDGELAB employs this novel methodology in the service of the epistemology of testimony, disagreement and groups, and develops the first integrated account of the epistemology of mass media in the literature. This framework is highly relevant in the context of a globalized society, replete with both easy-access information and misinformation: it is more important than ever to know what separates trustworthy sources of information from untrustworthy ones.',\n",
       " 'According to the WHO 235 million people suffer from asthma and 64M people have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, leading to 3M deaths per year worldwide. The cost of treating patients with all forms of lung disease is ~ €380B p.a., leading to the loss of >50M DALYS. Generally, patients with such respiratory diseases are treated by inhalation of medicines within aerosols, where the therapy (including medicine or biologics used in gene therapy) can be targeted directly to the lung. The accepted wisdom is that such pulmonary delivery requires aerosol droplet sizes of between 1 and 5 μm.  We have now shown that by using a new ultrasonic technology, we can create monodisperse aerosol droplets, which could be used for therapeutic delivery of medicines, genes and RNA to specific regions in the lungs. In one strand of the work we aim to demonstrate that this precise nebulisation technology improves the efficacy of treatment through enhanced drug uptake. In a second strand, we will demonstrate selective targeting of different tissue types in the lungs. For example, the epithelium in cystic fibrosis patients is currently extremely difficult to access leading to limitations in the amount and quality of data obtained for pre-clinical and clinical gene therapies. Similarly, targeting vascular cells is an appealing treatment for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, although, again, effective delivery necessitates that the therapeutic system transits defined and substantial anatomical barriers. The overall aim is to demonstrate that this new technology can define routes to new therapies, improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. To achieve this we will develop a prototype nebuliser based upon proprietary technology and show that different medicines and gene therapies can be delivered effectively to the lungs of a model mouse. We will also start to build a commercial team and work closely with industry to deliver impact and innovation to the market.',\n",

       " 'Caldera-forming volcanic eruptions can have severe impacts from the local to global scale. As vast quantities of magma are ejected during the eruption, they can trigger deadly pyroclastic density currents and lahars, release noxious gases and even alter global climate. At many calderas, episodic unrest in the form of pronounced uplift, increased seismicity and elevated gas emissions raise concern over the potential for such destructive eruptions. However, it remains difficult to ascertain whether the unrest observations indicate (1) an injection of new magma into the crustal reservoir, which could increase its potential for explosive eruptions, or (2) a sudden release of magmatic volatiles from a cooling and crystallizing reservoir, which would remain unlikely to erupt explosively. In this proposed project, I will develop a physics-based model of a magma reservoir to determine the processes involved in magma injection and evolution that may lead to episodic unrest. Of particular interest is how gases migrate through the system and alter reservoir volume. The model will simulate the thermo-mechanical evolution of a two-dimensional, three-phase (solids, liquids, gas) magma reservoir. By leveraging emerging continuum frameworks for reactive transport modelling, this work will expand existing two-dimensional models to simulate three phases in varying proportions in a computationally efficient approach. The reservoir model will be coupled to ductile-to-brittle crustal deformation to understand the conditions that lead to episodic unrest. I will compare simulation results with time series observations of ground deformation and gas emissions from Laguna del Maule in Chile, thought to be undergoing magma injection, and Long Valley in the US, thought to have experienced punctuated gas release. Results will bridge the gap among current models of three-phase magma dynamics and will improve understanding of the eruption hazard implied by caldera unrest.',\n",

We will use techniques from contraction algebras and noncommutative resolutions to classify, using both theoretical and constructive methods, and in the process verify an amended version of a string theory prediction.  We will use this to push forward curve-counting and derived category consequences and obstructions, and will work towards building a full database of 3-fold flops.

       " \"Mosquitoes serve as vectors for diseases including dengue and malaria, for which half the world's population is at risk. Mosquito-borne pathogens are transmitted during blood feeding, yet despite its crucial role in pathogen transmission, blood feeding behavior remains ill understood. The sensory integration of physical and chemical cues on the skin and below its surface, and the effect of pathogen infection on blood feeding are poorly characterized. These knowledge gaps are due to a lack of tools to quantitatively study blood feeding behavior. To overcome these limitations, I propose an innovative approach to study blood feeding by leveraging quantitative imaging, computer vision, and an engineered human skin mimic to create a high-throughput behavioral assay. Imaging mosquitoes feeding on a transparent skin mimic will enable the detailed characterization of the behavioral trajectory leading to blood feeding while simultaneously allowing the analysis of biting dynamics by imaging the expectoration of saliva. To unravel the behavioral effects of pathogen infection, I will compare blood feeding by non-infected Aedes aegypti (the main dengue vector) and Anopheles gambiae (an important malaria vector) with their dengue virus and Plasmodium falciparum infected counterparts. Next, I will use microfabricaton to embed artificial vasculature in the skin mimic to dissect the sensory cue integration underlying blood feeding. I will characterize the biting dynamics of mutant Aedes aegypti deficient in various sensory pathways feeding on skin mimics that present a defined set of cues. By combining my skills in biophysics with the host labs expertise in mosquito-pathogen interactions, this project will provide a deep understanding of the neurobiology underlying blood feeding by mosquitoes, and the effect that pathogen infections may have on this behavior. Elucidating the transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens will provide valuable insights to combat mosquito-borne diseases.\",\n",

Despite recent technological developments allowing for large-scale high-resolution functional imaging of the brain and direct neuronal recordings in behaving animals, there has been little effort in applying rigorous statistical approaches to test circuit connectivity patterns and synaptic mechanisms driving neural activity.\\n\\nExperimental evidence from classical conditioning and neuronal recordings have revealed that the cerebellum plays a fundamental role in fine-tuning of temporally precise behaviors. This project aims to elucidate the neural computation arising from anatomical and physiological constraints of the comparatively simple organization of the cerebellar cortical circuit, which allows the cerebellum to represent time-dependent sensory information necessary to drive behavior. Experimental and theoretical findings in the host laboratory have led to the hypothesis that dynamic synapse are a substrate for temporal representations and temporal learning. I will use sequential Monte Carlo methods to extract activity from calcium imaging data. Then I will use a generative model of the cerebellar network to infer the connectivity among the known cell types of the cerebellum as well as their synaptic properties. Finally, I will use information theory to examine the processing capacity of the cerebellar network, thereby providing new insights on evolutionary optimization of brain computation.\\n\\n The combination of my experience in statistical methods and the host laboratory's experience in state-of-art neural recordings and theoretical models, is a perfect match to break down the barriers to understanding the cellular mechanisms of circuit computations.

Misfolded alpha-synuclein (α-syn) accumulates in Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common ND, and recently a “prion-like” mechanism linked to the spreading of α-syn has been suggested for the pathology progression. The Zurzolo group demonstrated that α-syn fibrils spread between neuronal cells inside lysosomes through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), thin actin-based membrane protrusions mediating intercellular transport of various cargos. As known, lysosomes move along microtubules therefore this research aims to understand how lysosomes can move inside and through actin-based TNTs. The host lab also showed that the transferred α-syn fibrils induce the aggregation of soluble cytosolic α-syn in receiving cells and this project will unravel the mechanism by which α-syn fibrils escape from lysosomes to induce the aggregation of monomers in acceptor cells. In addition, since lysosomal dysfunction is a common feature of NDs, this research will shed light on the functionality and fate of α-syn-loaded lysosomes. Lysosomal dysfunction is also a trait of Lysosomal Storage Diseases (LSDs), a group of about 50 rare inherited metabolic disorders generally caused by the defective function of a specific lysosomal enzyme leading to the lysosomal accumulation of non-degraded materials and neurodegeneration in the forms most severe. This project will investigate the correlation between LSDs and NDs and the possible implications of TNTs in LSDs that represent a new perspective for LSDs etiopathogenesis. By combining my skills in lysosome physiopathology and the host lab expertise in TNTs and PD pathogenesis, this project will provide a deep understanding of the role of lysosomes in NDs pathogenesis and valuable insights to combat these incurable diseases.',\n",
       " 'The local equilibrium between cell proliferation and cell disappearance in epithelia is at the origin of the healthy function of our tissues and of their remarkable plasticity as observed in organ morphogenesis and adult tissue size regulation. Cell competition is the process by which cells with small proliferating rate and survival properties are forced to die through apoptosis by the surrounding cells. For example, cell competition enables the elimination of suboptimal healthy cells to limit the appearance of errors in our organs. However, activation of some oncogenes related to cell growth and cell survival in clones can drive the elimination of wild type (WT) neighboring cells and promote the expansion of the pretumoral population. Because many pathways altering cell growth and survival can trigger cell competition, there is no unique model of how cells induce death in their WT neighbors. Using the Drosophila pupal notum, it has been recently proved that local crowding and compaction of WT cells by fast-growing and apoptosis resistant clones can induce cell delamination in vivo, and that caspase activation is necessary for those cell extrusions. A similar “mechanical competition” was also described in mammalian MDCK cells. However, the exact mechanical cues driving cell elimination and the signaling pathway involved in this mechanotransductive process are still not known. Moreover, their contribution to pretumoral cell expansion has never been addressed in vivo. In this project, the experienced researcher will use Drosophila to i) characterise the mechanical conditions triggering cell elimination at the single cell level in vivo, ii) quantify the contribution of mechanical competition in cell competition scenarios implying oncogene proteins, and iii) define extensively where and when mechanical competition can promote pretumoral cell expansion through in silico predictions and in vivo validations.',\n",
       " 'PIGYVAX aims to create pig vaccine candidates against PEDV, a pathogen of swine causing significant challenges to the swine industry globally. This project will utilize yeast-based vaccine carrying nanoparticles of measles ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fused with PEDV spike protein (S1).  The multimerization of monomeric S1 antigen through RNP will increase immunogenicity due to better recognition of antigen presenting cells. As the yeast delivery system has strong auto-adjuvant properties, the vaccine does not require complementation with accessory adjuvant, which reduces the cost of vaccine production. Moreover, P. pastoris yeast, commonly present on fruits, is a certified safe microorganism for animal feeds rendering it a most practical and convenient way to deliver vaccines to large-scale farms. Therefore, we aim to use this vaccine platform to express S1 antigen of PEDV and deliver it orally to stimulate a protective immune response against PEDV in sows, which will be passively transferred to fully protect piglets from succumbing to the disease. In this project, Dr. Phanramphoei Frantz will utilize her knowledge on pathogenesis of PEDV and the yeast-RNP platform while gaining expertise on vaccine study and development from the host institute. This will initiate a successful collaboration project between Institut Pasteur and BIOTEC (Thailand) to where the experienced researcher will return after the project.',\n",

Despite mandates from the EC or the UN on tackling this situation, the industry remains heavily fossil-fuel dependent. Some efforts are being made in harnessing the wind to propel ships, going back to its origins. These are soft-tails, fixed-sails, flettner rotors, kite sails and even some wind turbines. However, they all remain at the research stage failing to represent a feasible and reliable power source.\\nSidewind is a breakthrough innovation in the use of wind power in transport ships. Designed to utilize the wind energy that is wasted around cargo ships by converting that energy (kinetic) into electricity, Sidewind incorporates horizontal turbines inside recycled cargo containers. This results in a flexible, practical and cost-effective solution to the maritime transport sector, without the need for major changes in the ship. By installing just 20 turbines (standard cargo ship), a ship will save 40% average fossil fuel and energy, translated in €328k per year.\\nThe EU has 329 key seaports, controlling around 60% of all container cargo ships. Our customers are maritime transport companies (183 in Europe, managing 23,000 vessels) and ship builders (150 shipyards in the EU). The number of vessels calling in the main EU ports in 2017 was estimated at above 2.1 million, and we will target the most important shipping companies. We count with support from public entities (Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources, Ministry of industries and innovation) and key industry players like Samskip (maritime transport), Hedinn (engineering in fishing industry) and Rafnar Hull (ship builder).\\nSidewind is opening a new market niche as provider of wind technology for the maritime transport.

       " 'During the fellowship, the experienced researcher Christopher V. Henri and his supervisors Anker Lajer Højberg and Jens Christian Refsgaard of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) will lead an effort improving the prediction of nitrate levels and of the production of nitrous oxide in soils by developing advanced and accurate modeling techniques.   The widespread use of agrochemicals has led to the contamination of many surface and groundwater bodies around the world. Nitrate is a highly problematic contaminant due to its adverse effect on human health and on ecosystems. Understanding the fate of nitrate in the subsurface is, however complex. Indeed, the pollutant undergoes in many cases a sequential biochemically induced degradation, which will reduce levels but also produce nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas.   Today, numerical models are essential in the management of such groundwater contamination. Yet, virtually all available numerical solutions for reactive transport in soils use Eulerian methods that present serious numerical issues, which significantly reduce their applicability.   The proposed project will represent a breakthrough in our representation of reactive transport in unsaturated soils by developing a stable and reliable Lagrangian method able to simulate reactive systems as the Nitrate biodegradation. The method will also allow to identify key processes triggering reactions in soils, which is primordial to improve our management of groundwater contaminations and to better understand the implication that the subsurface production of nitrous oxide can potentially have on climate.   The project will also allow the high-potential applicant to secure a position in Europe and the world-class host institution to maintain excellence through a series transfer of knowledge, training and communication strategy.',\n",
       " 'During the last century, the North Atlantic sea surface temperature exhibited superimposed long-term warming trend and multidecadal fluctuations. This multidecadal variability is referred to as the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). The AMV has been pointed as the source of marked climate anomalies and associated human impacts over many areas of the globe. This includes droughts in Africa and North America, decline in sea-ice, changes of tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic, as well as temperature and precipitation impacts over Europe.\\nDecadal climate forecast systems are able to capture the historical evolution of the AMV. This is encouraging for the prospect of getting skillful decadal predictions over continents through the impacts of the AMV. However, to date decadal prediction systems show only limited prediction skill over Europe in terms of temperature and precipitation. A possible explanation for this paradoxical missing skill is that current decadal forecast systems are missing key mechanisms to correctly simulate the AMV-Europe teleconnections and their associated predictability.\\nThe main goal of INADEC is to better estimate and understand the teleconnections between the AMV and European climate in order to precisely determine their predictability.',\n",
       " 'Mineral dust emission is ubiquitous in arid and semi-arid areas, representing a serious hazard for health, environment, and economy in many countries, in particular some of the least developed. Dust is a dominant contributor to the global aerosol load and plays a significant role in different aspects of climate and atmospheric chemistry. A key uncertainty in estimating present-day dust emissions is the contribution of human activities such as cultivation and grazing that disturb the soil. Recent research allowed representing natural and anthropogenic dust sources in global models based on high-resolution satellite data and land use maps. However, the accurate quantification of dust emissions and their attribution to natural and anthropogenic origin is currently hampered by deficiencies in dust emission modelling. Deficiencies include an incomplete representation of the physics of dust emission and a lack of skill to model certain atmospheric processes driving dust emission. DUST.ES will constrain present-day global dust emissions for both source types (natural/anthropogenic) taking into account (1) aerodynamic entrainment, a potentially important, yet previously neglected dust emission mechanism; and (2) moist convective dust storms (haboobs), intense dust events, which are unrepresented in global models, but  have a big impact on society. DUST.ES will estimate the regional and global relative significance of dust emissions caused by different dust emission mechanisms, meteorological dust injection processes, and source type. Results of DUST.ES will be a cornerstone to the longer-term goal of quantifying the effects of anthropogenic dust sources in the present and future climate. The beneficiary (BSC) hosts the WMO Dust Storm Prediction Regional Center for North Africa, Middle East and Europe, ensuring that the results have an immediate and sizeable benefit in several areas of public and private sectors across Europe and beyond.',\n",

The technology can be combined with state of the art Si device architectures such as FDSOI or more mature steep slope switches such as the tunneling field effect transistor (TFET) functioning as technology booster to improve low power /high performance operation characteristics of transistors. The later can have an impact on energy efficient nanoelectronics. NQCFET has competitive advantages against rival emerging steep slope switch technologies and complements rather than competes with mainstream Si devices, therefore showing a high potential for non-disruptive innovation and a prospect for fast and smooth entry to large volume production.\\n\\nThe GR-GATE project will produce prototype transistor arrays at TRL 4 to show that the NQCFET technology is scalable to larger area wafers with acceptable device yield having reduced gate lengths and lower gate dielectric thickness in compliance with scaling trends and technological requirements as adopted by the industry. This will demonstrate that the technology has a commercial value calling for IP protection through an international patent filing. In addition, technology valorisation is planned in order to assess the manufacturability and viability of the NQCFET technology and identify further advanced development steps that need to be taken in order to bring the technology to maturity (TRL 8-9). It is expected that large European technology development laboratories will have a crucial role in validating the technology but also promoting it to their industrial affiliates targeting a licence agreement with key chip manufacturers to enable volume production.

The diagnosis and monitoring of an infection (e.g. HIV, malaria, bacterial infection), the monitor of a chemotherapy outcome (e.g. in cancer patients) or even the diagnosis of rare diseases (e.g. sickle cell disease, non-Hodgkin lymphomas), relies on analysing the number and/or the morphology of different types of blood cells.  Here, we aim to validate a portable, single-cell counting/identification platform that can be used to diagnose and monitor diseases at the point-of-care. The platform consists of a low-cost, handheld, battery-operated, scanner and a disposable microfluidic biochip. The underlying technology, termed ‘Label-free Cell Identification (L-CI) technology’, is based on the integration of novel, microfabricated components that enable to simultaneously image and count thousands of cells at high spatial resolution. If successfully commercialized, the L-CI platform will be the first medical instrument to perform a blood cell counting test by the end user at home, in few minutes. The potential is enormous as the L-CI platform will replace millions of blood cell tests that routinely performed by trained personnel in clinics and hospitals in the developed world but it will also make blood cell tests available in the developing wold.',\n",
       " 'In a number of European countries, old railway transport infrastructure earthworks are suffering from serviceability problems or failures and need continuing and costly maintenance/remediation works. This is becoming a major constraint for railway owners and operators, especially in the light of the increased risk of hazards posed by climate change. The hypothesis of this research is that biocementation (a technique that uses natural biological processes to bind soil grains) is a viable and sustainable technique for improving the structural stability of railway earthworks, and hence, the resilience of the EU’s transport infrastructure. The hypothesis will be tested through the application of the technique on earthwork materials of the UK rail network. After establishing improved microbial systems and processes, the project will involve advanced soil testing. The testing will give high quality data on the hydromechanical properties and behaviour of biocemented soils. Careful consideration will be given to the behaviour of the soil under unsaturated soil conditions (soil voids partially filled with water) which has not been researched. The data will be interpreted by constitutive modelling of the soil behaviour. The model will be implemented to commercial software, giving researchers and engineers a useful predictive tool for the analysis and design of biocemented soils. Having assessed the technique and the durability of the biocementation in the laboratory, a significant advance of this research will be the pilot application of the technique on actual railway assets, made accessible by a major owner and operator of railway infrastructure. This novel technique is proposed to be environmentally superior to conventional grouts (which are toxic) and other common soil stabilisers, e.g. cement or lime (linked to high CO2 emissions). Overall it is more sustainable because the micro-organisms used are renewable, environmentally friendly and safe (non-pathogenic).',\n",

       " 'Plant diseases are a major constraint on food production. To rationally design efficient and resilient disease control strategies, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogen virulence. Most pathogens rely on secreted proteins called effectors to manipulate the host machinery for their benefit and perform their life cycle. In VAMEAP, we propose to characterize the virulence activities of the metalloprotease effector AVR-Pita from Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Despite a strong selection pressure against this effector, AVR-Pita is maintained in populations of the pathogen suggesting a crucial role for the fitness of M. oryzae. Yet, next to nothing is known about the virulence activities or host targets of AVR-Pita. Here we propose an ambitious combination of biochemical and functional approaches to bridge this knowledge gap. We will survey the natural diversity and sequence polymorphisms in AVR-Pita and investigate the impact of its loss on the fitness of M. oryzae. We will identify the virulence targets of AVR-Pita using protein-protein interaction screens and characterize the protease activity of this effector. Beyond the knowledge that this project will gather on AVR-Pita, it will also help to understand the biology of metalloprotease effectors commonly found in fungal pathogens. The multidisciplinary approach developed in this project will be a powerful tool to further understand fungal virulence and help design new resistance strategies to control fungal crop diseases.',\n",

In addition, African rainforest support the forestry sector which contributes 3-6% of the gross domestic product across the Congo Basin with most foreign export directed to Europe. As such, African rainforest currently represents both a local and foreign economic driver and provides important ecosystem services through the negative feedback on the global carbon cycle. Both remote sensing data and tree ring stable isotope measurements have shown that these forests are currently being subjected to a long-term drying trend, raising fears over the drought resilience of tropical tree species and the persistence and magnitude of this important terrestrial carbon sink. Here, we combine eco-physiological and dendrochronological research with a model based approach to increase our understanding of the response of African tropical tree species under changing climatological conditions across the central Congo Basin. We will integrate several data streams including inventory data on soil properties and associated leaf traits, wood traits, phenology, retrospective dendrochronology and wood core stable isotope and calcium tracer time series, in order to constrain a data-informed mechanistic ecosystem model (MuSICA). Using a novel tracer experiment we will corroborate the use of a calcium [Ca] tracer in tropical tree species for rapid dating and eco-physiological research into drought resistance. Accurate model predictions, based upon Ca tracer measurements made during this action, will provide estimates of the vulnerability of tree species to future drought conditions. Our results will have important policy implications as the demise of important tree species could have significant effects on ecosystem services, e.g. affecting the carbon balance, as well as a direct economic impact on sustainable local and EU timber trade.',\n",

Loss of the fragile balance within this complex ecosystem is involved in numerous pathologies, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The incidence of IBD is increasing and affects individuals in challenging years of their lives, with immunosuppressive treatments that are not always effective. \\nIBD results from a combination of genetic predisposition, alteration of the gut microbiota, and environmental influences. Thus, deciphering the host-bacteria crosstalk will improve our understanding of IBD and enable new preventive and therapeutic strategies. Caspase recruitment domain 9 (Card9), one of the IBD susceptibility genes, codes for a protein involved in the response to fungi and bacteria. Sokol and colleagues showed that Card9-/- mice have an increased susceptibility to colitis, due to an altered gut microbiota that is not able to metabolise tryptophan into aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands. In humans, comparable mechanisms seem to be involved, as microbiota of IBD patients exhibit impaired production of AhR ligands, which mirrors the Card9-/- genotype.\\nWe aim to decipher the mechanisms involved in the modulation of the microbiota and its metabolic activity by Card9. For this purpose, we will take advantage of a strong collaborative environment and cutting-edge techniques, including gnotobiotic animals, cre-lox technology, transcriptomics, metabolomics and systems biology.

       " 'Revealing why and how reactions take place is the essential goal for fundamental investigations of chemical reactivity. The breaking and forming of chemical bonds in a chemical reaction is directly associated with the depletion and accumulation of electron density between atoms. In the recently proposed Molecular Electron Density Theory (MEDT), the origin of chemical reactivity is deduced directly from the changes of electron density, as analysed by well-established quantum-chemical tools. This contrasts with typical approaches (e.g., molecular-orbital theory), where chemical reactivity is inferred, indirectly, from mathematical entities that are not directly associated with changes in electron density. Building on the new chemical insights obtained by the application of MEDT to pericyclic reactions and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions, the principle goals of this project are (a) to develop and extend MEDT to additional electron-density-based quantum chemical tools and more accurate types of computations and (b) to convince physical and organic chemists that MEDT is preferable to traditional methods for the rationalisation of chemical reactivity. To achieve the second goal, we will revisit traditional chemical concepts, many of which were proposed even before the development of modern quantum chemistry, and assess whether they are consistent with observed electron density changes. We will also explore applications of MEDT, both to traditional textbook reactions in organic chemistry and to the intricate reaction pathways associated with prebiotic chemistry, especially the prebiotic syntheses of imidazole, nucleotides, and other touchstone prebiotic molecules. By these means, we shall establish MEDT as a new paradigm for interpreting chemical reactivity, based on the experimentally observable electron density.',\n",

Here, a research program with three major goals is proposed: 1) broadly conceived synthetic studies will be undertaken, which are expected to give access to C–H acids with a wide range of acidity and steric confinement. 2) These C–H acids will be applied to address one of the most general limitations currently encountered in organocatalysis: The enantioselective conversion of small and unbiased substrates. 3) The developed C–H acids, which are expected to enable unprecedented acidities and catalytic activities, will be employed in the activation of increasingly less reactive electrophiles, for example aliphatic aldehydes but also esters and olefins, for which enantioselective organocatalytic reactions are currently very limited or even unknown. Overall, this research program will aim at the design, synthesis and application of C–H acids as platform for solving several long standing challenges in asymmetric organocatalysis. The introduction of C–H acids for organic synthesis is expected to enrich the toolbox of synthetic chemists in both academic and industrial laboratories.',\n",
       " 'Despite the abundance of organic compounds in Nature, only 12 contain fluorine. In contrast, fluorinated organic materials account for over 40% of all pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Closer inspection of the fluorination patterns in these functional molecules reveals striking extremes towards perfluorination (in both 2D and 3D scaffolds) or single site fluorination predominantly in aryl substituents. Consequently, most fluorinated moieties in functional materials lack stereochemical information and are thus achiral. This disparity between the paucity of naturally occurring organofluorine compounds and their venerable history in functional molecule design confirms the enormous potential of fluorinated materials in the discovery of novel properties. That progress has largely been confined to 3 dimensional achiral and 2 dimensional achiral architectures reflects the synthetic challenges associated with preparing stereochemical defined multiply fluorinated systems. A major limitation in the construction of C(sp3)-F units remains the need for substrate pre-functionalisation via oxidation and the competing substitution/elimination scenario that compromises efficiency in the deoxyfluorination. This problem is magnified in the synthesis of optically active fluorides where the deoxyfluorination can compromise the enantiopurity of the starting materials. The principle aim of RECON is to facilitate exploration of 3D, chiral space by providing access to multiply fluorinated, stereochemically complex organofluorine materials from simple feedstock using inexpensive, commercially available fluoride sources. In providing a modular platform to rationally place function on a structural basis, exploration of uncharted chemical space will accelerate the discovery of next generation materials for medicinal and agrochemistry, material sciences and bio-medicine.',\n",

The motivation that drives the EU-Africa DIGILOGIC project is to facilitate and stimulate the unleashing of the innovation potential within Africa’s young engineers and entrepreneurs. It achieves this through the creation of the first Pan EU-Africa sustainable network of DIHs, focussing on the topic of smart logistics. DIGILOGIC sees the horizontally connecting logistics industry at the converging point of interest for digital innovation for social and business development, a crucial node for Europe’s and Africa’s sustainable prosperity.

These cells will become operational in case of an emergency/pandemic but to make economic sense, the same approach of rapid flexibility and adaptability will be used to deal with surging demand in ‘normal circumstances’.\\nTo realise this concept, we will first work on three levels individually: network level, connected manufacturing/digital manufacturing level and technical level, the latter referring to tweaking manufacturing lines, developing required materials and establishing links with testing/certification. Next, we will demonstrate the repurposing of 5 existing manufacturing lines within 48hrs towards manufacturing of ‘textile PPE’ (surgical and respiratory face masks, medical aprons) and ‘respiratory ventilators’ (invasive and non invasive) that comply with necessary testing and certification and proceed with the embedment of the reservist cells at the partners in the network.

Innovative and accurate radio measurements of cosmic rays and neutrinos with LOFAR promise to provide new answers.\\nIt is generally believed that ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are produced in extragalactic sources like gamma- ray bursts or active galactic nuclei, while the lower energy cosmic rays come from our own Galaxy. At what energy this transition takes place is still unknown. Here we focus on disentangling Galactic and extragalactic components by studying the mass composition between 10^17 and 10^18 eV, a regime that is also crucial for understanding the origin of the extraterrestrial neutrinos detected by IceCube.\\nWe do this with LOFAR, the first radio telescope that can detect individual cosmic rays with hundreds of antennas. This incredible level of detail allowed us to finally understand the complicated radiation mechanism and to perform the first-ever accurate mass analysis based on radio measurements. Our first data reveal a strong proton component below 10^18 eV, suggesting an early transition to an extragalactic component. With upgrades to our detector and techniques we will be able to improve our sample size by an order of magnitude, resolve more mass components, and identify the origin of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos.\\nThe technique may be scaled up to higher energies, measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory, where mass information is needed to correlate cosmic rays with their astrophysical sources and to confirm the nature of the cutoff at ~10^19.6 eV.\\nWe can even search for particles beyond the GZK limit. With the Westerbork telescope we have already set the best limit on cosmic rays and neutrinos above 10^23 eV. With LOFAR we will achieve a much better sensitivity at lower energies, also probing for new physics, like the decays of cosmic strings predicted by supersymmetric theories.',\n",
       " 'Skin wounds represent a significant economic and social burden, associated with a long-lasting nature and need of care. Most of the commercially available patches for wound healing have been proved very useful in wound management but are yet to demonstrate a direct effect on the progression of the healing. This has significant implications in the quality of the clinical results obtained so far. Skin patches can be substantially improved in terms of the healing time, with clear benefits in the patient’s quality of life and in reducing health care systems costs, as well as on the quality of the new skin. The use of hydrogel-based patches has clear advantages in maintaining the moist environment required for improved healing but those devices are not yet designed to actively aid the healing process. Because the healing cascade is a complex and step wise process, PATCHED proposes to proof the feasibility and efficacy of a hydrogel-based patch designed to address that complexity and time dependence. PATCHED relies on the versatility of a technology developed under the scope of ComplexiTE ERC AdG that will allow extending its outputs towards a concurrent biomedical application. Therefore PATCHED will produce a prototype of an innovative multi-component hydrogel-based patch that contains selected biomolecules that will have different actions according to different microenvironments of the wound. By tailoring the composition, size and shape of the components, a time-dependent release of the biomolecules will be achieved according to the different healing microenvironments. This should result in a dynamic and cooperative effect that will address the complexity of the wound process resulting in improved healing. Overall PATCHED represents the proof of concept of a commercialization opportunity that might advance the wound care market, directly impacting the life of millions of patients.',\n",

Ludic culture created communities from early childhood to a ripe old age. Did these groups play together, or did they play different games, with distinct rules? And did they play similar games to us? This interdisciplinary project will provide the first comprehensive study of the evidence. Written, archaeological and iconographic sources are abundant, but forgotten in museums and libraries. This neglect is due to the modern Western view of games as children’s pastime, if not a waste of time. Ancient play and games reflect the gendered, religious, economic, and political fabric of a society, as much as they shape the lives of players by transmitting a cultural identity and an intangible heritage. Ludic culture evolves over time and this project intends to provide a benchmark by reconstructing this history in the Greek world, from the birth of the city-state, c. 800 BCE, to the Roman conquest in 146 BCE, and in the Roman world from the Republican age, c. 500 BCE, to the end of the Western Roman Empire, c. 500 CE. \\n \\nLocus Ludi will identify, categorize, and reconstruct games and play thanks to close linguistic, historical, archaeological, typological, topographical, iconographic, and anthropological studies. Ludic culture also mirrors interactions between different populations, as in the romanisation process, and religious shifts.

       " 'Tomato is one of the most economically relevant crops in the world and is the main model system for fruit ripening studies at biochemical, genetic and molecular levels. In this climacteric fruit, a sudden increase in respiration takes place at the onset of ripening, usually in concert with increased production of ethylene that eventually impacts fruit color, firmness, taste, and flavor. During ripening, tomato accumulates high contents of health-promoting carotenoids (pro-vitamin A, antioxidants), which require a high production of carbon precursors and ATP. In this respect, both mitochondrial and chromoplast respiration have been proposed to play important roles in fruit ripening and carotenoid metabolism. The general aim of this project is to determine the contribution of mitochondrial respiration to the supply of energy and carbon for the production of carotenoids in tomato fruit during ripening. In particular, we will perform metabolomics of genetically modified tomatoes with altered mitochondrial and chromoplast respiration at different ripening stages. Furthermore, 13C- and 14C-labelling experiments will be performed to trace the fate of carbon from primary to secondary metabolites. In parallel, we will measure the relative glycolytic and TCA cycle fluxes and, for the first time in tomato, the in vivo activities of mitochondrial electron transport chain pathways by using the 18O fractionation technique. Combining these data with the analysis of transcript and protein levels of the main components of respiratory and carotenoid pathways and mathematical modelling will unveil novel metabolic checkpoints and connections between primary and secondary metabolism during fruit ripening. The generated new insights should contribute to the implementation of new biotechnological approaches to produce fruits with enhanced levels of carotenoids and other health-promoting secondary metabolites.',\n",

This project proposes the commissioning and upgrade of a novel high-power RF system in S-Band to perform systematic breakdown studies and conditioning of cavities in this frequency range, in particular interesting for medical applications. The main challenge is the implementation of a hard real-time control of amplitude and phase at microsecond scale of the pulsed megawatt RF power delivered to the structures under test.

More than 99% of the Internet data traffic is carried by a network of global optical fibers. Despite their great importance, today's optical fiber networks face a looming capacity crunch: The achievable rates of all current technologies characteristically vanish at high input powers due to distortions that arise from fiber nonlinearity. The solution of this long-standing complex problem has become the holy grail of the field of the optical communication.\\n\\nThe aim of this project is to develop a novel foundation for optical fiber communication based on the nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT). The NFT decorrelates signal degrees-of-freedom in optical fiber, in much the same way that the conventional Fourier transform does for linear systems. My collaborators and I have recently proposed nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) based on the NFT, in which the information is encoded in the generalized frequencies and their spectral amplitudes (similar to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing). Since distortions such as inter-symbol and inter-channel interference are absent in NFDM, it achieves data rates higher than conventional methods. The objective of this proposal is to advance NFDM to the extent that it can be built in practical large-scale systems, thereby overcoming the limitation that fiber nonlinearity sets on the transmission rate of the communication networks. The proposed research relies on novel methodology and spans all aspects of the NFDM system design, including determining the fundamental information-theoretic limits, design of the NFDM transmitter and receiver, algorithms and implementations. \\n\\nThe feasibility of the project is manifest in preliminary proof-of-concepts in small examples and toy models, PI's leadership and track-record in the field, as well as the ideal research environment.\",\n",

CHANCE will be implemented through a novel approach integrating Computable General Equilibrium and Microsimulation models. The specific research objectives of this project have not been addressed in the past.  In this sense, the project will contribute to enhance EU scientific excellence by consolidating novel multidisciplinary research. CHANCE will reduce this gap in the literature through two specific relevant multi-regional case studies in settings where climate, energy policies and trade agreements are at the core of the current political debate: first, relations between Mexico and the USA (outgoing phase) and second, relations within the 28 Member States of the European Union (return phase).  Through these analysis, identifying the factors which induce regressive policies, CHANCE could guide improvements in the design of policies. CHANCE will provide me with training and experience to widen my current expertise and promote my future career as an independent researcher. By the end of CHANCE, I expect to become a highly multidisciplinary researcher in the field of environmental management and decision-making, which will enable me to obtain a permanent position in Europe. Furthermore, the combination of knowledge and experience at MIT (outgoing phase) and at BC3 (return phase), and more specifically, of my supervisors (John Reilly and Mikel Gonzalez-Eguino), will offer me multidisciplinary training, to which I would not otherwise have access.

       " 'How molecular and mechanical cues interplay to coordinate the morphogenesis and patterning of embryonic structures is an open question in developmental biology. The early avian embryo is an ideal model for the study of such interplay as it exhibits highly regulative development, is greatly amenable to live imaging approaches and can be readily mechanically challenged. Whereas avian embryos have long been known to remarkably adapt and readjust cell fate upon surgical perturbations, such regulative potential has been investigated solely from a molecular standpoint, leaving the role for mechanical forces unexplored. This proposal builds on our recent results and methods characterizing the mechanical control of gastrulation to investigate the role of mechanical forces in embryonic regulation and in cell fate plasticity. Specifically, we propose 1) to develop innovative tools allowing to perturb the mechanical state of early embryos in order characterize the role of forces during development; 2) to test whether a mechanical self-organizing system underlies the remarkable regulative potential avian embryos; 3) to investigate the role of mechanical forces in mesoderm, embryonic and extra-embryonic regional fate allocation. To this end, we will use an interdisciplinary approach combining novel transgenic quail lines, live imaging, and pharmacological/molecular/optogenetic/mechanical perturbations along with theoretical frameworks and modeling approaches. These studies will decipher the interplay between cellular, molecular and mechanical cues that ensures the robust, yet plastic allocation of cell fate in amniote embryos (i.e. reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans).',\n",

High-resolution images recorded in intact, living organisms deliver insights into the complex interplay of molecules, cells and tissues in real time. Even though the resolution of microscopes has been pushed beyond the diffraction limit, providing important insights into the inner workings of single cells, we still lack an understanding of plasticity in development: How does one embryo differ from another and how can we describe the 'average', stereotypic embryo?\\nTo address this long-standing multi-disciplinary challenge, we propose to develop an entirely novel microscopy hard- and software platform to systematically image and analyze embryos in real time. We will design and assemble a fast and flexible multimodal light-sheet microscope (SPIM) with adaptive illumination and detection from multiple sides. A fundamentally new concept of this proposal is the ability to adaptively change the recording's spatial and temporal resolution during the experiment: The microscope learns to acquire only the data of interest. Using a high-throughput sample feeder, many samples can be automatically pumped through the microscope and imaged within seconds for large-scale comparative developmental studies. Real-time processing will dramatically reduce the size of the data stream and thus, provide for the first time a platform to collect data from hundreds of samples. At the same time, by establishing a model for the observed embryo, we will integrate information from multiple samples to draw statistically relevant conclusions.\\nOur ground-breaking concept of smart microscopy speeds up the acquisition, reduces the amount of data and limits photo-toxicity. It enables us to address fundamental questions in embryonic development that are out of reach by traditional methods. Smart microscopy will open up a new field of research: systematic real-time developmental biology.'\",\n",
       " 'Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS) based on high-throughput embryo genome sequencing is currently utilised in In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) to select for euploid embryos prior to uterine transfer in order to increase implantation potential. The methodology for the acquisition of genetic material is controversial, as the invasive embryo biopsy required for PGS may compromise embryo quality. Moreover its long-term biosafety has not been evaluated. Consequently, the development of non-invasive methods to screen out aneuploid embryos is paramount. The host research group recently first reported that human IVF embryos release extracellular vesicles (EVs) and demonstrated their uptake by primary endometrial cells (ECs). Our pilot analysis of the embryo-derived EV transcriptome revealed an abundance of genes that may be involved in the establishment of endometrial receptivity. Additionally, our RNAseq on ECs, which had internalised human embryo-exported EVs, showed a gene-upregulation profile relevant to implantation. Collectively, our findings introduce a novel concept to the state-of-the-art whereby human embryos deliver a functional EV-transcriptomic cargo to ECs to mount an implantation response. Delineating the EV transcriptome, and studying the consequence of its delivery in ECs, potentiates mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of implantation. The project will characterise for the first time the transcriptomic cargo of euploid and aneuploid human embryo-exported EVs and scrutinise the effect of its internalisation on endometrial function. This cutting-edge work may negate potentially harmful invasive embryo biopsies for PGS by instead utilising biomarkers in EVs – a ‘natural cell biopsy’. EV biomarkers could also inspire therapeutics to enhance endometrial receptivity. This programme is especially timely, as leading innovators in the field currently focus to provide the community with a single therapeutic approach to tackle poor endometrial function.',\n",

Although sepsis is initiated by infection, it is not the infection per se, which kills the patient, but rather the body’s response to it, in particular, the development of a shock, which is initiated by deterioration of the blood vessel system, hypotension, insufficient oxygenation of organs and finally their functional breakdown. For a clinician this situation occurs suddenly and there is no diagnostic tool to predict this event early enough to initiate adequate measures to guide the patient and prevent its death. \\nDespite of large efforts and developments in the last decade septic shock is still the world biggest killer causing 5-6 million deaths a year worldwide.

       " 'The Repro-light project aspires to successfully initiate a transformation of the European LED lighting industry by the year 2020 since European lighting companies have been facing fierce competition from Asia while at the same time prices for LED luminaires are rapidly falling. By developing an intelligent LED-based luminaire with a modular, stackable architecture the project seeks to change the industry’s view of the LED luminaire as a generic, disposable object into a customized, sustainable product with high functional value. Breaking the rules of traditional luminaire design by using innovative technologies and materials to completely forgo wiring and make luminaires completely stackable as in the Repro-light project has never been attempted before. Through the modular design and the development of a smart production scheme costs and time of luminaire manufacturing can be reduced substantially as well as their environmental impact.  Now is an extremely crucial moment for creating a sustainable solution for LED luminaires since the LED market is in the middle of a massive transformation, changing the value proposition of LED-based lighting solutions from a focus on energy efficiency to functional values. The Repro-light luminaire will fulfil this value propositions by employing intelligence and having a positive impact on peoples’ health. The Repro-light consortium is perfectly suited to be the spearhead of this lighting “revolution” as the entire value chain is represented and the consortium is structured around a sound industrial backbone.  With representatives and driving forces of the European lighting industry as well as manufacturers of basic products, experts on lighting sustainability and the Social Sciences, the Repro-light consortium possesses the excellence and the influence to not only execute this project successfully but also invoke a sustainable change in the European lighting industry beyond the lifetime of the project.',\n",

During the ERC program, we were able to show how simple & readily accessible start materials could be transformed into high value-high interest chemicals through straightforward “one pot” operations. We were also able to show that the diversity of structures accessible using this chemistry is remarkable. Furthermore, it is highly sustainable; representing a very efficient, benign & extremely low waste approach to the production of sought-after chemical frameworks. However, one problem prevailed. While it worked exceptionally well on a small research scale, its overall usefulness and its industrial relevance were severely curtailed by scale-up issues, even when the latest continuous flow technologies were applied. The need to achieve good light penetration, combined with the poor solubility of oxygen, seemed to castrate the potential of this chemistry to provide global solutions. A key breakthrough was made towards the end of the ERC program with the realization that creating and projecting a cloud (using a nebulizer to make fine droplets) into a light filled chamber could solve ALL the problems and lead to large scale reactions. With the current proposal, we seek to explore and fully automate this highly innovative nebulizer process in order to develop a robust prototype reactor with excellent prospects for further dimension enlarging (to industrial pilot plant scales & beyond). Furthermore, it is obvious that this “nebulizer fix” may also be superbly suited to other biphasic reactions. Our plan has the support of pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca in the form of an automation expert who will act as mentor to the program.

Modern automation technology, e.g. in production and micro assembly lines, is now facing the challenge of manipulating of extremely small objects, with dimensions typically smaller than the width of a human hair. Existing gripping technologies are running out of steam in this range: controlled handling is either impossible by conventional processes such as suction grippers, or decreased reliability leads to low yields and productivity. Industry is urgently looking for new handling concepts and this trend is predicted to intensify after the CORONA crisis when automation will gain in importance for ensuring reliable production.\\n \\nThe technology developed in the researcher’s original ERC Grant SWITCH2STICK turned out to be ideally suited for this purpose. Eduard Arzt’s team successfully created the fundamentals and first prototypes of gecko-inspired surfaces with switchable adhesive functions. As the technology is bioinspired it is highly energy-conserving and sustainable. Now, increased reliability during the handling process has become possible. Using novel materials for the surface structures, the research group has demonstrated in their lab the gripping of objects down to dimensions below the thickness of human hair. This function of micropatterns to handle microobjects reliably is the groundbreaking new idea which will be validated for market readiness in this proposal. Considering that the relevant industrial sector of automated micro assembly is already a multi-billion Euro market with a strong growth rate, a new solution is expected to have a large economic impact, especially in Europe where many market leading automation companies are based.',\n",

However, this life supporting therapy is limited by the shortage of donor livers. As a consequence many patients die while on the transplantation waiting list. The SME Hep-Art has developed a bioartificial liver, the HepaRG-AMC-BAL, that has already shown to increase the survival time in animals with severe liver failure.

Organ bioengineering and regenerative medicine are promising new technologies that can help reduce the burden of liver shortage by increasing the number of organs available for transplantation. However, current bioengineered livers lack a functional vascular network that can readily allow their transplantation into a living host. Previous studies by the candidate have shown successful recellularization of acellular liver scaffolds using endothelial cells and hepatic cells in a perfusion bioreactor, creating a vascularized human liver organoid. However, its vascular network was unable to maintain vascular patency under constant blood flow for long periods of time. Hence, better understanding of how experimental cell seeding conditions of porcine liver scaffolds influence their re-vascularization efficiency is critical to achieve sustainable vascular patency after transplantation. In order to accomplish this, the impact of fluid flow pressure and the seeded cell number will be investigated in re-endothelialization efficiency of an acellular porcine liver scaffold. Furthermore, bioreactor pre-conditioning with fluid flow pressure ramping and sequential cycles of vascular growth and maturation will be used to induce re-vascularization, maturation, and enhanced function to potentially increase vascular patency. Finally, re-vascularized liver scaffolds will be transplanted into 5-10Kg pigs and short and long-term vascular patency will be investigated. Hence, the long-term objective of this project is to create a functional re-vascularized porcine liver scaffold, a critical first step towards the effective transplantation of bioengineered livers.',\n",

This approach is unique and has never been used before. The so called 'squalenoylation' technology may be considered as a generic platform to construct nanomedicines with high drug loading and targeted drug release triggered by the spacer between the drug and the squalene moiety. Remarkably, it was shown that these nanomedicines were more efficient and less toxic than the parent drugs. The gemcitabine-squalene (Gem-SQ) nanomedicine, our first candidate for further pharmaceutical developments, was shown not only to display an impressive anticancer activity in experimental tumors but also to overcome drug resistance, thus addressing a major challenge in tumor therapy. These pre-clinical data deserve further development towards translation into the clinic for the treatment of the pancreatic cancer, a devastating disease. However, the squalenic acid (SQCO2H), the chemical template essential for the synthesis of the Gem-SQ bioconjugate, is currently obtained through the Van Tamelen reaction which cannot be employed for the preparation of a clinical sample of Gem-SQ, because of the use of CrO3 (a toxic compound) and the poor yield of the reaction. Therefore, the synthesis of SQCO2H represents a lock for further clinical development of our Gem-SQ nanomedicine. The goals of the present proposal are : (i) to perform the total synthesis of SQCO2H through a new « green » chemistry way (which represents in itself a real innovation) allowing (ii) further  regulatory acceptable preparation of Gem-SQ nanoparticles.

       " 'Targeted therapies have been widely used in tumors driven by RAS oncogenes. Unfortunately, no effective RAS inhibitors have been translated to the clinic, and attempts to block other signaling nodes usually fail due to the emergence of drug resistance. Chromatin dependent signal transduction and transcription are a point of confluence of multiple signaling networks elicited by hyperactive RAS. Hence, pharmacologic disruption of gene-regulatory dependencies imposed by mutant RAS represents an attractive therapeutic interface less prone to the emergence of resistances. The urgent clinical need of RAS-related therapies is well exemplified by pancreatic cancer, one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers, which will be the disease background of my studies.\\nUsing the innovative approach of targeted protein degradation, I want to characterize and understand the consequences of acute mutant KRAS degradation on chromatin remodeling and transcription. Further engineering the models of acute KRAS degradation will enable to devise cellular reporters of KRAS-dependent chromatin regulation amenable to high-throughput phenotypic drug and genetic screens. Coupled to a facile readout via high-throughput microscopy, these screens will allow me to identify molecules and genetic perturbations that interfere with KRAS-dependent, transcriptionally active chromatin. Lead molecules will be characterized for the underpinning mechanism of action and assessed for therapeutic potential. Building on already existing experimental and computational pipelines in the Winter laboratory at CeMM-Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, this project will increase the understanding of transcriptional control elicited by oncogenic KRAS and could open new avenues for the treatment of RAS-driven tumors based on chemical modulation of critical chromatin and transcription regulators.',\n",

Currently, the established treatment of metastatic melanoma includes dacarbazine (DTIC) administration associated with response rates of between 10-20% with severe side effects during treatment. Recently, the BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and the MEK inhibitor (trametinib) were approved for the treatment of melanoma patients with mutated BRAF (about 50% of patients) while there are several PI3K, AKT, mTOR and MEK inhibitors being tested in clinical trials. However, the effectiveness of all these treatment modalities is limited by intrinsic or acquired resistance. The host lab has discovered a novel mechanism of resistance to a broad spectrum of drugs in clinical trials/use for melanoma therapy mediated by the kinase-like protein TRIB2. This means that TRIB2 could be used as a biomarker to select melanoma patients for specific treatment options and to develop co-treatment strategies to overcome drug resistance. This project pretends to (1) understand the mechanisms underlying TRIB2-mediated resistance to MEK inhibitors and to (2) further develop TRIB2 as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for melanoma. Ultimately, the expected results will be highly relevant for the clinic as they might allow to select melanoma patients for specific treatment options and to develop co-treatment strategies to overcome TRIB2 mediate resistance.',\n",

Existing scholarship has shown how the structure and function of Chinese families have adapted to changing political and economic circumstances but little is known about the changes in intimate spheres of Chinese families. This project will approach the subject of modern Chinese family life from an unconventional angle, analysing it as a process of practices and experiences. By setting a new agenda that moves from structures of family relationships to the quality of relationships and through examining ‘doing intimacy’, this project will take a closer, fresher, critical look at the Chinese family dynamics as they are lived. Informed by the emerging literature on gender, intimacy and modernity, this project will examine intergenerational relations as well as gender and sexual relations in the family. Is there an intimate revolution taking place? How is ‘modernity’/’tradition’ closely linked with practices of intimacy? To what extent can doing intimacy be a site of empowerment/domination for women? What will the study of Chinese families tell us about agency and local/global change? Through a multi-sited ethnography (mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan), this study will also compare practices of intimacy in various sites and examine whether/how they are by-products of particular socio-cultural configurations.

SPuMP is unique in that it will have pulsation free flow, highly accurate flow control, and on reservoir temperature control for reagent stability. When used in conjunction with the SpacePharma advanced lab, complex, remote controlled, end-to-end fluidic based experiments can be performed in a variety of microgravity platforms, most notably on nano-satellites. The pulsation free flow enables a new set of experiments, such as direct droplet based macro-molecular crystallization, to be performed in the microgravity environment. Enabling temperature control on the reservoir itself, enables reagent stability that is unprecedented. With the use of a battery reagents can be stored at 4 degrees celcius and then warmed up to their useable temperature before beginning an experiment. SPump, while being developed to initially take 5% of the estimated 1000 experiments based on micro-/millifluidic in the microgravity research market each year, also has a wide range of uses in the portable micro-/millifluidic system market, such as with point of care devices, due to its compact size, smooth flow, and ease of filling when already integrated into a closed system.

       " 'On average, each European citizen produces approximately 200 kg of municipal biowaste per year, representing between 118 and 138 million tonnes of biowaste annually arising in the EU. The main municipal biowaste management systems currently existing in Europe represent one-way flow systems in which materials and resources are underused, limiting its potential recovery into high-value products. VALUEWASTE proposes an integrated approach in urban biowaste upcycling for the production of high-value biobased products, developing the first complete solution to fully valorise biowaste that can be replicated across Europe. We will implement three new value chains that will use urban biowaste as raw material for its valorisation into high-value end products in a cascading process, generating economic, social and environmental benefits: food & feed proteins and other ingredients, and biobased fertiliser. VALUEWASTE will be developed at two very different European locations, Murcia (ES) and Kalundborg (DK) with the purpose of finding a solution both technical and socially adapted to the different socio-economic contexts exiting across Europe. Social initiatives will be created to increase consumer awareness and acceptance of urban biowaste-derived products. End-user products applications and new market opportunities will be demonstrated. Outcomes of the project will contribute to new standardisation, and will be useful information for EU policy makers in terms of waste management and in the adoption of new policies.',\n",
       " 'How differentiated cells can change their identity is a fascinating question. Indeed, natural interconversions between functionally distinct somatic cell types (aka transdifferentiation, Td) have been reported in species as diverse as jellyfish and mice, while experimentally induced reprogramming of differentiated cells has been demonstrated. The relative ease with which cellular identities can be reprogrammed raises a number of exciting questions: What mechanisms and steps allow a given cell, but not its apparently identical neighbours, to naturally acquire a new plasticity potential and change its identity? How does the cellular context influence the ability of a cell to be reprogrammed? What cellular mechanisms must be counteracted to allow natural reprograming to occur? What circuitry underlie the impressive efficiency observed in natural events? The proposed project tackles these questions\\nTo systematically identify the molecular networks and cellular requirements of Td, we established a simple model of natural Td, in C. elegans, where the conversion of a rectal cell into a motoneuron is followed in vivo. This model is unique: it is 100% efficient, predictable and provides the first unambiguous demonstration, at the single cell level, of natural Td. The study of such natural event has revealed a key asset to unravel the discrete steps of the process, their control and the conserved cell plasticity factors promoting its initiation, while leading to important concepts conserved across phyla.\\nWe propose here 4 aims to push new frontiers and: i) Define what makes a cellular context permissive; ii) Elucidate the conserved nuclear complexes and network architecture promoting efficient reprogramming; iii) Identify mechanisms that protect the differentiated identity and act as a brake to Td. Understanding cell plasticity in vivo will have a tremendous impact on our perception of developmental and cancerous processes and could open new avenues for regenerative medicine.',\n",
       " 'The interdisciplinary research explores the ways transnational autobiographies by black authors address different forms of black mobility in the Americas during the Age of Revolutions and its aftermath until the onset of the US American Civil War (1760-1860). During that time, large parts of the Americas gained their independence from the European colonial powers. Simultaneously, black-authored narrative texts emerged in the region. Among them, autobiographies played a key role as vehicles of asserting black selfhood and participating in societal discourses. Four major types of black life narratives developed at the time: slave narratives, Indian captivity narratives, spiritual autobiographies, and memoirs-as-travelogues. In all of them different form of (im)mobility played a defining role in shaping black identities and experiences. \\nThe research is the first of its kind to study transnational black autobiographies from across the Americas in the Age of Revolutions with a focus the (voluntary or enforced) spatial, socio-cultural, and narrative mobilities of black people. Its objective is to produce a series of scholarly essays, to be subsequently joined into the first comprehensive study on the subject. Drawing on the theoretical and methodological approaches of Inter-American, Black Atlantic, Mobility, and Autobiography Studies, the project closes a gap in the scholarship of the Americas and the Atlantic world. Due to the aesthetic innovation and societal relevance of autobiography in the region from 1760-1860, the research will be based on a literary analysis of the major types of black Inter-American life writing of the era. In so doing, it will not only chart black contributions to autobiography but also advance the theoretical study of the genre. \\nHome to the renowned Institute of Black Atlantic Research and its world-class scholars of the Early Black Americas and Black Atlantic (Prof Rice, Dr Hoermann, Dr Saxon), UCLAN provides an ideal host institution.',\n",

Currently, structural and energy retrofitting of buildings is treated separately with no established holistic approach. An integrated retrofitting system using advanced composite materials combined with thermal insulation can improve the seismic and energy performance of buildings and offer savings in application costs (>25%). \\nDuring the last two decades, the use of fibre-reinforced composite materials for structural retrofitting applications has gained popularity. The recent generations of advanced composites for construction have proven to be very effective in seismic retrofitting of structures. However, they are often expensive, lead to incompatibility issues, and promote the use of cement-based binders, of which the production largely contributes to the global CO2 emissions (5% of global man-made CO2 emissions). \\nThe main objective of THORAX is to develop the next generation of sustainable fibre-reinforced composite materials to be used for the combined structural and energy retrofitting of buildings, protecting the residents during earthquakes, whilst increasing their energy performance. \\nThe efficiency of this novel retrofitting system will be investigated through a multi-scale experimental campaign accompanied with a detailed numerical investigation. The host organisation has a leading expertise in the fields of fibre-reinforced composites and seismic retrofitting techniques.

       " 'Motivation: Wireless access is being used extensively in our life. Wireless access enabler, the frequency bands, on the other hand, is very scarce. It is very important that any wireless access system utilizes the frequency at outmost efficiency. One of the poorly utilized wireless bands is the FM Band between 88–108 MHz. The band is being allocated only for relatively high quality audio broadcast around the world. This band has good propagation characteristics and therefore its coverage range and its penetration through buildings are excellent. As FM coverage is so ubiquitous around the world, several applications are already considered to better exploit this useful band: (a) Software defined radios for public safety, (b) New digital audio broadcast services, and (c) the development of an emergency message delivery services. With one of these applications and good propagation characteristics, FM Band can enable a fully connected Europe. \\n\\nIt is of significant interest to investigate and characterize channel properties of the FM Band for the potential wireless systems. Therefore, the objective of this novel research is for the first time to develop a complete channel characterization of FM Band and then to perform analytical directional channel modelling. The newly introduced models will then be validated through field trials, and will be able to support the parameters of the contemporary wireless systems with multiple antennae. \\n\\nApproach: The directional channel models will be developed through (i) geometrical (ray tracing) and (ii) tapped delay line (parametric stochastic modelling) approaches by considering 2-D (time and angular) channel impulse response.  The models will be based on the specification of directional channel impulse response functions, large and small channel effects. The measurement campaigns will be carried out via channel sounders.

As the most sustainable and cheapest disposal option, agricultural use of biosolids is encouraged as a part of a resource recovery solution by turning waste into a key resource. Anaerobic digestion is a common practice for sludge stabilization as an energy-efficient process before the beneficial reuse of biosolids. However, presence of the emerging micropollutants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products is creating potential human and environmental health threats despite the technological advancements in anaerobic sludge digestion. Europe needs to take immediate action for solving this issue; to safeguard the Union's citizens from environment-related pressures and risks to health and wellbeing within objectives of the EU 7th Environment Action Programme. RADIOFREPOLIS intends to investigate the occurrence and transformation of target pharmaceutical and personal care products by applying an innovative and energy-efficient radio frequency sludge pretreatment followed by anaerobic digestion as the first time in the literature for moving towards non-toxic environment. Proposed solution will reduce the uncontrolled release of micropollutants into the environment via sludge as well as reducing the quantity of excess sludge, improving the quality of sludge and increasing renewable energy to obtain a positive energy balance of the overall process, which will contribute to competitiveness of Europe. RADIOFREPOLIS will transfer knowledge on this newly acquired custom-built radio frequency heating technology to Europe and develop a novel project with multidisciplinary collaboration. Furthermore, this fellowship will increase knowledge and experience of the highly qualified researcher in area of environmental biotechnology where Europe needs highly trained researchers.\",\n",
       " 'The process of embryogenesis involves coordinated changes in gene expression at both transcriptional and translational levels. In zebrafish, translation at early stages of embryo development relies on maternal, oocyte-derived ribosomes which are completely replaced by newly synthesized somatic ribosomes within 5 days after fertilization. Strikingly, preliminary data obtained in the Pauli lab suggest that maternal and somatic ribosomes diverge not only in rRNA content but also in protein composition and structure. Despite their heterogeneity, potential differences in the function of maternal and somatic ribosomes remain unknown. The dual ribosomal system present in zebrafish embryos thus provides a unique, powerful tool to address the controversial idea regarding the existence of ‘specialized ribosomes’ having distinct functions in translation.\\n\\nIn the proposed research project, I will investigate the regulatory potential of maternal and somatic ribosomes during zebrafish embryogenesis. To this end, I will analyze the translational activities of maternal and somatic ribosomes by determining substrate specificity, preferred mRNA features (sequence and length) and kinetics of translation. In addition, I will study the regulation of ribosomal degradation during embryogenesis in order to understand how and why the maternal ribosomal machinery is turned-over despite the high energy cost associated with making a new set of ribosomes. To accomplish these aims, I will combine diverse state-of-the-art methodologies, including in vivo and in vitro translation assays, biochemical ribosome purification techniques, SLAM-seq, and molecular and genetic studies in zebrafish. The results obtained have the potential to reveal novel regulatory mechanisms acting during vertebrate embryogenesis and will help to pinpoint the functional significance of heterogeneous ribosomes.',\n",
       " 'Photosynthesis is a biological process of primary importance, as it provides the energy that drives food, feedstock and biofuel production and mitigates climate change. Light in excess of photosynthetic capacity can be damaging, thus ways to protect against damage have evolved, including ways to minimize light absorption, detoxify reactive oxygen species generated by excess light, and dissipate excess absorbed light. Together, these processes are known as photoprotection. Despite the physiological importance of photoprotection, the molecular mechanisms that protect against light stress remain largely unknown, especially those that protect from prolonged light stress. The objective of the proposed research project is to solve molecular mechanisms of photoprotection in plants. My specific aims are to 1) investigate the function of known involved factors in sustained energy dissipation in the model plant Arabidopsis, 2) identify novel molecular players and 3) use an organism that is genetically adapted to cope with high light stress, the evergreen Norway spruce. The research will be carried out in my laboratory where genetics, biochemistry, biophysics and physiological approaches will be combined to address this problem. The research in my group will provide insights into fundamental mechanisms of light energy capture, utilization and dissipation and will lead to the identification of new targets for manipulation, key to increasing yields of energy and food crops.',\n",
       " 'Feralisation is a complex process that occurs when a domestic population is returned to the wild. It impacts species invasion biology, speciation, conservation and hybridisation and can be thought of as the reverse of domestication. Domestication has been an area of intense interest and study ever since Darwin, and useful as a model for evolution and the effects of strong directional selection. This project will identify underlying genes and mechanisms of trade-offs and adaptations surrounding feralisation, by integrating population genetics, genome-wide association and functional genomics in a parallel (previously developed/established) feral and laboratory chicken system. Despite domestication being used to identify genes affecting a large number of traits that change with selection, almost nothing is known about the genomic changes associated with feralisation. The process of feralisation involves the sudden return of both natural and sexual selection; such forces influencing predatory, foraging and mate choice decisions, exerting strong effects on a once domesticated, now feral, population. As such, feralisation provides a unique opportunity to observe the genomic response to selection from a known (domesticated) standpoint, and identify the genes underlying these selective targets. The combination of feralisation with domestication provides a powerful tool to address a multitude of important questions currently predominating the field of biology. How do gene polymorphisms affect small-scale quantitative variation, particularly in wild population? How does the genome respond to selection, and how can (cryptic) variation be maintained and increased in the face of this selection? What mechanisms underlie gene and organismal trait variation. Feralisation combines the advantages of analysis conducted on natural populations (with the relevance to evolutionary theory and population genetics), with the genetic and genomic resources available to domestic animals.',\n",
       " 'Transposable elements play major roles in the genome evolution of eukaryotes, and cause harmful mutations, deleterious side effects, and disease. These costs drive their eukaryotic hosts to evolve counter-adaptations, which are so effective that TEs are thought to only survive long term by invading new naïve species. These transposable element invasions appear to occur via horizontal transfer, and can result in the rapid, selfish spread of the element through a species.  Despite the evolutionary importance of the host-transposable element relationship, there are still major gaps in our knowledge of how they evolve and persist. Host resistance can evolve astonishingly rapidly, but the evolutionary mechanism by which this happens is unknown. Some horizontal transfer events result in successful invasions, but we have little idea of what factors favour success, or, except in rare cases, how the transfer events occur.  \\n\\nThis proposal outlines a four-part research programme to address these gaps, examining both sides of the coevolutionary equation. Specifically, I will examine the rapid evolution of suppression from the host side, to understand the population genetics of this process.  I will study invasions from the perspective of the transposable element, and ask what genetic factors contribute to their success. To accomplish these objectives, I will take advantage of a unique opportunity-- an ongoing invasion of a model transposable element in a close relative of the genetic model fly. Finally, I will examine the role of parasites as vectors of TEs ,to understand  mechanisms of horizontal transfer between species.',\n",
       " 'In this project, we will use social modifications of heritability as measurement devices for assessing how social conditions shape opportunity structures, and how human potential is either constrained or enabled. Major themes in family demography and social stratification such as equality of opportunity in the age of mass education, changing family structures in the 20th century, development of life courses and careers, and intergenerational transmission processes all motivate an important role for human genetics. Up to recently, little of these efforts have directly engaged with genetic research. A common criticism of genetic methods is that they are silent on social context and environmental interactions. We turn these criticisms into tools, by assessing how genetic effects vary across contexts and environments. First, we study social change across cohorts, as influential theory suggests heritable dispositions will increase in importance when opportunity structures expand or social norms are in flux. We will test these ideas on the recent decades of family and fertility changes, and the expanding opportunity structures in education and labor markets. Second, we ask whether genetic and environmental influences on social stratification and family demographic outcomes change over the life course as the consequences of individual choice and social structures accumulate. Third, we will examine the similarity in outcomes of parents and their offspring from a genetically informed standpoint. A synergy combining state-of-the-art techniques from molecular and behavior genetics with high-quality population register data and strong theorization and measurement of socio-environmental factors from the social sciences is highly innovative cross-fertilization of research that will yield major new insights.',\n",
       " \"Plants, just like animals are highly developed multicellular organisms. In contrast to animal cells however, plant cells are surrounded by a rigid, carbohydrate-rich extracellular layer, the cell wall. This cell wall provides plants with mechanic support and a dynamic chemical signalling and metabolic environment. To allow for cell expansion, cell division, coordinated tissue growth and interactions with the environment, the cell wall status constantly needs to be sensed and modified. How plant cells perceive and signal their cell wall status is poorly understood. Here, I propose an integrated approach to uncover ligands for cell wall sensing receptors as well as their downstream signalling components. Specifically, my project aims to identify the ligands for two genetically validated cell wall receptor families, using a chemical biology approach. Next, we will analyse and validate the mode of ligand-receptor interaction by combining protein X-ray crystallography, quantitative biochemistry and reverse genetics in Arabidopsis. A detailed ligand-binding and receptor activation mechanism will allow us to specifically interfere with cell wall receptor function in vivo, and to assess their biological relevance for cell wall structure and its chemical properties. Using atomic force microscopy, we will then test if the receptors are distributed uniformly at the membrane or whether they are arranged in complex 'sensosomes'. Finally, we will characterize if plant cell wall receptors can directly act as mechanosensors. With defined receptor-ligand pairs and clear phenotypes at hand, we will try to uncover downstream signalling components for plant cell wall receptors and to validate our atomic models in planta. My ultimate goal would be to design and test cell wall receptor agonists and antagonists, which will represent powerful tools to alter cell wall homoeostasis in Arabidopsis, and potentially in crops.\",\n",
       " 'Working memory (WM) capacity, the ability to temporarily store information in mind, is especially important to a broad range of intellectual abilities and for optimal performance in everyday life settings. However, WM capacity is highly limited, which necessitates determining the factors that optimize/constrain efficient WM storage and remembering. To this end, new behavioural and neuroimaging evidence indicates that WM performance is influenced by attentional control. However, precisely how attention influences WM is not yet fully understood. Here, the applicant proposes to test the hypothesis that specific alleles in two dopamine-related genes, DAT1 and COMT, are associated with neural correlates of attentional encoding and attentional maintenance in WM, which in turn influence WM capacity. To explore this hypothesis, a combination of cutting-edge experimental techniques will be employed. Specifically, the applicant will use molecular genetics, electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERPs), and behavioural measures to delve into the biological pathways underpinning the interplay between attentional control and WM capacity. The expected results will map to specific genotypes, the phenotypes (cognition/behaviour) and endophenotypes (neural markers/oscillations) of attentional encoding and attentional maintenance, and their modulation of WM. Findings will shed new light on the underlying mechanisms constraining WM capacity and shift the knowledge frontier. The proposal negotiates a subject matter of considerable importance for European society because WM deficits are a predominant symptom in many mental and neurological diseases that fall within Europe’s health priorities. During the proposed project, the fellow will acquire scientific and complementary transferable skills based on her personalized career development plan and through intra-European mobility and advanced training will reach a position of professional maturity in research.',\n",

       " 'From early childhood, many poor children brought up in segregated communities observe socio-economic failures such as poor living conditions, liquidity constraints, extremely high unemployment and low education levels attained by adults. Enhancing their aspirations is believed to be a tool capable of breaking one of the poverty feedback loops: poverty has been identified as a cause of the failure to aspire to one’s own potential, and at the same time, low aspirations are among the potential causes of persistent poverty. Consequently, adolescents from areas of high deprivation are generally believed to have low aspirations, though, in fact, their aspirations vary considerably, and may be generally high. This signals two main aspiration biases: aspirations failure and aspirational gap. This project is aimed to investigate how stimulating success/failure environments can reduce aspiration biases of the segregated poor, which, according to theory, should increase their chances to escape the poverty trap. The project has an interdisciplinary character: it is aimed to investigate the psychological construct of aspirations in the economic context in educational environments. Using cutting-edge methods from behavioural and experimental economics, we will experimentally investigate to what extent exposure to success/failure environments will lead to a significant decrease/increase in aspirational biases. From the methodological perspective, we will first design a novel approach to the experimental elicitation of aspirations, then we will design an experiment manipulating success/failure to assess their effects on aspirations. From the empirical viewpoint, using experimental data, the project will shed new light on the relationship between socio-economic background and aspirational biases, and thus test the predictions of economic theory. To address the concern of external validity, the proposed experiments will be conducted in different cultural settings.',\n",
       " \"Pregnancy entails remarkable whole-body biological adaptations. Extensive evidence in humans shows significant alterations in taste perception and nutrient preference throughout pregnancy, resulting in frequent food cravings with a recurrent search for high-caloric, high-palatable foods. However, the underlying neurocircuits implicated in specific pregnancy-related eating disturbances are still unknown. In line with that, the project hypothesizes that pregnancy modifies the neuroconnectome of critical brain regions implicated in taste and ingestive behavior, altering maternal dietary preferences and habits favoring the consumption of high-palatable food. The persistence of abnormal dietary patterns, in the prevailing western life-style, may underlie serious detrimental metabolic and neuropsychological outcomes in both mothers and offspring that often lead to eating disorders and obesity vulnerability. The project aims to use a combination of cutting-edge methodologies in the mouse, including behavioral, whole-brain imaging, chemogenetics, and fiber photometry to establish the genetic and neurocircuits underlying pregnancy-related eating behaviors and its effects on offspring's metabolic health. The present proposal will provide novel insights on the link between specific physiological conditions (gestation), feeding neurocircuits and behavior as well as transgenerational metabolic and neuropsychological impact, unraveling new preventive strategies (nutritional and healthier lifestyle) to control the rising incidences of “food addiction”, disturbed eating patterns, and obesity predisposition. Ultimately, the knowledge generated by NEUROPREG can reduce overall costs in obesity and related disorders, that consumes more than $1.2 trillion of the global health system every year.

These disadvantages refrain the use of IUD contraceptive which exacerbates the unintended pregnancies, sized yearly in 85 mills and representing billions of euros in social costs worldwide.\\nIn response, we have developed Aspivix, a new disruptive gynecological device that reduces the pain and eradicates the bleeding during the exploration procedure. Our patented device will replace the Tenaculum forceps, unchanged for over 100 years, to provide gynecologists an easy-to-use device where gentle and firm cervix uterus grasping and traction is needed. Thus, our device will facilitate the adoption of IUD, which could avoid up to 8% of unintended pregnancies and reduce derived social costs. Besides, Aspivix is intended for a single use which prevents the risk of contamination and cross-infection. Overall, Aspivix has the potential to shorten the intervention procedure (2 steps instead 7), which will represent for the physician a 28% economic benefit. As result, Aspivix will fulfill the needs of more than 64 M of women worldwide/year, a market that is projected to grow at a CAGR2016-2021 of ~6.5% due to the high demand of IUD insertions and is valued in more than €385M.',\n",

As highlighted by the Innovate UK Cell Therapy Catapult, by 2017 the cell-based therapy manufacturing industry will be worth more than €4.5billion. To realise this opportunity, it is vital clinicians and manufacturers have access to efficient tools that are also repeatable. Several methods exist that enable the manual manipulation of cells, amongst which microinjection tasks is the most common. However, current techniques are labour intensive, vary in quality, and lack the measurement of force between the tools used and the cell needed to reduce damage during contact. Moreover, as these processes are not automated and can only be performed one cell at a time, it is prohibitively expensive to produce new cell-based therapies at the volumes needed for clinical trials. To address these unmet needs, we present ‘HapticCell’, a robotic micromanipulation platform for low cost autonomous microinjection tasks.

       " 'In contrast to human or rodent embryos, ungulate embryos do not implant into the uterus right after blastocyst hatching. Before implantation, the hatched ungulate blastocyst must undergo dramatic morphological changes characterized by cell differentiation, proliferation and migration processes leading to the development of extra-embryonic membranes, the appearance of a flat embryonic disc and gastrulation. This prolonged preimplantation development is termed conceptus elongation and deficiencies on this process constitute the most frequent cause of reproductive failures in ungulates, including the 4 most relevant mammalian livestock species in Europe. The purpose of this project is to elucidate the factors involved in conceptus elongation by gene editing and in vitro culture approaches. A first objective will be to identify key genes involved in differentiation processes by RNA-seq analysis of different embryo derivatives from bovine conceptuses at different developmental stages. Subsequently, the function of some of the genes identified as well as others known to play a crucial role in mouse development or putatively involved in embryo-maternal interactions will be assessed. For this aim, bovine embryos in which a candidate gene has been ablated (KO) will be generated by CRISPR and transferred to recipient females to assess in vivo the function of such particular gene on conceptus development. A second set of experiments pursue the development of an in vitro system for conceptus elongation that would bypass the requirement for in vivo experiments. For this aim we will perform metabolomics and proteomics analyses of bovine uterine fluid at different stages and will use these data to rationally develop a culture system able to sustain conceptus development. The knowledge generated by this project will serve to develop strategies to enhance farming profitability by reducing embryonic loss and to understand Developmental Biology questions unanswered by the mouse model.',\n",

       " 'The low share of sustainable consumption signals an important need to investigate consumers’ motivations for sustainable consumption. A better understanding of consumers’ motivational drivers can be helpful in increasing the sustainable consumption and, thus tackling environmental problems. Consumers’ motivations for sustainable consumption have been investigated from different theoretical perspectives. A comprehensive theoretical framework explaining why people [do not] buy sustainable products is a gap in the literature. This research project contributes to the Goal Framing Theory which has so far been discussed on the conceptual level mainly. This theory is different from the most well-known theories of consumer pro-environmental behavior (such as normative theories) in the sense that it integrates three categories of individual motivations, namely gain (weighing costs and benefits), normative (personal moral norms) and hedonic (positive emotions) motivations. This research project investigates the effects and relationships of gain, normative and hedonic motivations on sustainable consumption. As of context, four sustainable products namely electric cars, solar panels, car sharing and smart thermometers are selected. Moreover, this research examines the moderating effect of socio-demographic variables including gender, and situational variable including social norms, policy and infrastructure on these effects. Utilizing experimental design, this research will provide novel insights on how to communicate and promote sustainable consumption.',\n",
       " \"A topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is a model of quantum field theory which computes topological invariants. Although TQFTs were invented by physicists, they are also of mathematical interest because of their relation to quantum topology. Particularly interesting examples of 3d TQFTs arise from Chern-Simons (CS) theory with non-compact gauge groups. A connected component of the phase space of PSL(2,R) CS theory is identified with Teichm\\x7füller space, and its quantum theory corresponds to a specic class of unitary mapping class group representations in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. By using quantum Teichm\\x7füller Theory (qTT), Andersen and Kashaev construct a one parameter family of TQFT's dened on certain shaped triangulated pseudo 3-manifolds. On the other hand, Teichm\\x7füller theory has an interesting generalization originating from the deformation theory of super Riemann surfaces which initially was motivated by super string perturbation theory. In the super generalized case, the gauge groups is replaced by the super group OSP(1|2). Recently, qTT of super Riemann surfaces has been constructed by using coordinates associated to the ideal triangulations of super Riemann surfaces. To this date, we lack mathematical understanding of TQFT's with non-compact super gauge groups. This proposal aims to construct and study TQFT's based on super qTT as follows: Construction of the tetrahedral partition functions from the mapping class groupiod representations of super qTT using a version of charging, establish tetrahedral symmetries and prove well-denedness and topological invariance for a certain class of triangulated shaped pseudo 3-manifolds and finally make calculations for different examples. These results are expected to build a bridge between very different areas of mathematics, thus possibly opening new research gates completely inspired by physics.\",\n",
       " 'With this project, called HADES, we aim to provide the first detailed, combined analysis of benthic diagenesis and microbial ecology of some of the deepest oceanic trenches on Earth. We argue that deep trenches, some of the most remote, extreme, and scantly explored habitats on Earth, are hotspots of deposition and mineralization of organic material. With the development of novel autonomous in situ instrumentation to overcome large sampling artifacts from decompression, we will i) determine rates of benthic metabolism and the importance of the deep trenches for the marine carbon and nitrogen cycles, ii) explore the unique benthic microbial communities driving these processes, and iii) investigate the proposed great role of virus in regulating microbial performance and carbon cycling in hadal sediments. By comparing trenches from contrasting oceanic settings the project provides a completely novel general analysis of hadal biogeochemistry and the role of deep trenches in the oceans, as well as fundamental new insights into the composition and functioning of microbial communities at extreme pressure.',\n",
       " 'The  goal of this proposal is to support the paradigm shift in the health care of people with multiple chronic conditions in Europe from a focus on disease-based curative models to holistic person-centered self-care through personalized,supervised exercise therapy and education.\\nThe problem:The impact of multimorbidity on the individual and society is massive and much greater than the impact of single chronic conditions alone. However, effective treatments are missing and research and health care reinforce an inefficient and burdensome single-disease framework.\\nThe solution:Exercise has the potential to disrupt the ‘vicious cycle’ of systemic inflammation associated with chronic conditions and improve health in multimorbidity. A personalized exercise and education program aimed at supporting subsequent self-management by the individual will be developed in an interdisciplinary collaboration, building on evidence from biomarkers, patient involvement and methodological expertise. Self-reported,physiological and societal effects will be investigated in a randomized controlled trial comparing the personalized program with standard single-disease models of care. Scientific and public dissemination and implementation ensuring significant personal and societal benefit is fundamental to the proposal.\\nThe proposal is associated with high risk, as the current disease-based curative models involve treatment by several highly specialized health care providers, while the new person-centered self-management model is centered on a personalized program delivered by one health care provider.\\nThe ground-breaking nature of this proposal lies in its potential to revolutionize how health care is organized for people with multimorbidity, by giving them one primary care provider, and how we use non-surgical treatment in health care and science by bringing the concept of precision medicine into multimorbidity and utilizing it to improve treatment outcome with exercise therapy as the model.',\n",

Heat exchangers in engines has been identified as a key enabling technology for low-emission power systems that is vital to the EU economy and is of great societal concern. Development of high-performance heat exchangers is a complex engineering challenge requiring academic contributions at the forefront of engineering science, which will enhance the EU’s competitiveness by delivering economically and environmentally improved products. Having identified charge air cooling as a key enabling technology for low-emission power systems, here we propose an integrated approach to doctoral training in the area of engineering design leading to four doctorates covering diverse aspects of their mechanical engineering: structural vibration, stress & thermal analysis, additive manufacturing (AM), multifunctional metamaterials, fatigue & materials development. This project brings together a consortium of industrial and academic partners in a novel and bespoke doctoral training programme that is multi-disciplinary in its content and inter-sectoral with regards to the employability of the technology leaders of tomorrow. The programme provides a coherent training platform that inherently nurtures technical, creative and entrepreneurial skills. The central theme of Engineering Design within the programme enables us to build a training structure which is technically broad yet scientifically rigorous, while having the academic depth expected of a doctoral programme. The programme provides mobility, industrial experience and academic foundations in an integrated manner that will uniquely equip our future technology leaders to contribute to high-value innovation within EU industry.',\n",
       " 'We propose precision lattice QCD computations aiding the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, we will address currently observed anomalies such as those displayed in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and lepton flavour universality tests in semi-leptonic B meson decays. We will further supplement searches for new physics through the computation of hadronic inputs, which combined with experimental results allow the determination of elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, thereby providing precision tests of the standard model.\\n\\nWe will compute a large set of hadronic form factors of semi-leptonic B(s) and D(s) meson decays including pseudo-scalar and vector final\\nstates. State-of-the-art computations of these have two major shortcomings: the use of effective theories for the b-quark, and the treatment of vector final states as QCD-stable particles. We will eliminate the former of these by utilising very fine lattices which allow for the direct simulation of the b-quark near its physical mass. The latter will be addressed by merging specialist expertise in the computation of such form factors with that of hadronic scattering processes. This will result in the first calculation that takes the unstable nature of the vector final states in QCD into account. This is of paramount importance in order to address the observed anomalies in the B to D* and B to K* decays. We will compute the full basis of possible currents thereby providing standard model predictions as well as inputs for tests of beyond the standard model theories. Further, we will use the approach of massive QED in lattice QCD computations to provide an independent cross check of the electromagnetic corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarisation.  This work will provide vital inputs in searches for physics beyond the standard model which are needed to fully exploit large ongoing experiments at the Large Hadron Collider and at facilities in Japan and the US.',\n",
       " 'Even though it is a cliché that most Byzantine arts originated in, for and as rituals, scholars largely neglect their ritual origins and functions. Medievalists tend to treat visual, literary and performing arts as distinct from each other. In the medieval world, however, these arts were often combined to produce effective rituals. Recognizing the importance of considering these three arts together, NetMAR will use the concepts of “ritual”, “ritualization” and “performance” to bring together all types of Byzantine arts under one roof. Given the importance of Cyprus within the Byzantine and Western medieval worlds, NetMAR will use the same approach for Western medieval arts where they coexisted and interacted with their Byzantine counterparts.  Building on twinning’s huge potential for knowledge transfer, training and exchange of best practices between the three partnering institutions, NetMAR will work towards filling the networking gaps and deficiencies between UCY and its advanced partners in the field of Medieval Studies. NetMAR will also have a dedicated focus towards both promoting the involvement of female and male ESRs in the coordinating institution and strengthening its research management and grant writing skills. Furthermore, NetMAR will participate in the production of new tools and services that will benefit the tourism and culture industry, along with other interested stakeholders and public authorities.  The collaboration of the three partners, which mainly aims at strengthening the abilities, networks, skills and knowledge of UCY, will be performed within the framework of a number of CSA including: staff exchanges, expert visits, webinars, workshops, conferences and a summer school, as well as dissemination and outreach activities. These CSA will enable UCY to produce high-impact publications, establish an interdisciplinary, peer-reviewed and open access scholarly journal, and create a critical mass of highly qualified young scholars of both sexes.',\n",
       " 'This proposal investigates the nexus between time and the construction of the feminine in Late Antique and Byzantine hagiographical discourses. By looking both at ways time is experienced through the body and construed by society and religion, GenTime engages with a highly debated problem in Byzantine studies: why did female saints progressively disappear over the Byzantine millennium? GenTime argues that this trajectory has to be understood against the eschatological expectations shaping early Christian ideals of female holiness. In the 2nd and 3rd century the impending end of times subsumed any other temporality and led to the subversion of traditionally construed “women’s time”. Once the Roman Empire became Christian, the eschatological horizon was reinforced in Byzantium by the widespread circulation of apocalyptic motives, adopted by the Imperial power for political and moral purposes. Eschatologically-motivated narrative patterns about women saints became entrenched and their ongoing success made it hard to accommodate new experiences of holiness when other models of lay temporality eventually emerged during the Middle Byzantine era. GenTime looks at stories about women saints produced between the 2nd and the 13th century CE by adopting a longue durée perspective and using narratology to analyze how patterns of temporalities are inscribed in the text. It builds on feminist phenomenology to highlight the persistence of strategies used to control women’s time within patriarchal social orders. GenTime works with medieval sources and it reflects on the dialectics between integration/assimilation, minority/majority cultures, gender/societal values, all of them of major concern in modern societies. In doing so, it raises awareness about the ways gendered discourses of time have historically been used to promote lifestyles that, ultimately, have less to do with women’s empowerment and more with power struggles between competing social groups.',\n",
       " 'Most changes in mineralogy, density, and rheology of the Earth’s lithosphere take place by metamorphism, whereby rocks evolve through interactions between minerals and fluids. These changes are coupled with a large range of geodynamic processes and they have first order effects on the global geochemical cycles of a large number of elements.\\nIn the presence of fluids, metamorphic reactions are fast compared to tectonically induced changes in pressure and temperature. Hence, during fluid-producing metamorphism, rocks evolve through near-equilibrium states.  However, much of the Earth’s lower and middle crust, and a significant fraction of the upper mantle do not contain free fluids. These parts of the lithosphere exist in a metastable state and are mechanically strong. When subject to changing temperature and pressure conditions at plate boundaries or elsewhere, these rocks do not react until exposed to externally derived fluids. \\nMetamorphism of such rocks consumes fluids, and takes place far from equilibrium through a complex coupling between fluid migration, chemical reactions, and deformation processes. This disequilibrium metamorphism is characterized by fast reaction rates, release of large amounts of energy in the form of heat and work, and a strong coupling to far-field tectonic stress. \\nOur overarching goal is to provide the first quantitative physics-based model of disequilibrium metamorphism that properly connects fluid-rock interactions at the micro and nano-meter scale to lithosphere scale stresses. This model will include quantification of the forces required to squeeze fluids out of grain-grain contacts for geologically relevant materials (Objective 1), a new experimentally based model describing how the progress of volatilization reactions depends on tectonic stress (Objective 2), and testing of this model by analyzing the kinetics of a natural serpentinization process through the Oman Ophiolite Drilling Project (Objective 3).',\n",
       " \"'ERIDIAN will develop a market-ready quantum random number generator for Device Independent (DI) Quantum Cryptography (QKD), which offers the best possible security guarantees.  The prototype developed in ERIDIAN will enable major industrial players to make DI QKD a commercial reality.  Current, classical cryptography is based on the assumed difficulty of certain mathematical problems and thus insecure against future mathematical advances and against quantum computers.  Quantum cryptography gives future-proof security guaranteed by physical laws, but until now is very difficult to commercialise:  the user must trust the communications equipment and its supplier, making a mass-market approach impossible.  The DI approach to quantum cryptography uses strong, directly observable data correlations, technically a 'loophole-free Bell Inequality Violation' (BIV), to guarantee security.  Because the security (or not) of the connection is transparent to the user, there is no need to trust the communications provider, greatly facilitating commercialisation.  The first loophole-free BIVs were demonstrated in 2015, using laboratory-grade random number generators developed in the ERC starting grant AQUMET.  ERIDIAN will advance to the prototype stage this randomness generation technology, a critical element of the BIV and thus a requirement for the DI approach.  The availability of a commercial-grade randomness source suitable for BIVs will allow industrial actors such as telecommunications providers to enter the DI field and offer solutions to a broad range of customers.'\",\n",
       " 'Universality is a central concept in several branches of mathematics and physics. In the broad context of statistical mechanics and condensed matter, it refers to the independence of certain key observables from the microscopic details of the system. Remarkable examples of this phenomenon are: the universality of the scaling theory at a second order phase transition, at a quantum critical point, or in a phase with broken continuous symmetry; the quantization of the conductivity in interacting or disordered quantum many-body systems; the equivalence between bulk and edge transport coefficients. Notwithstanding the striking evidence for the validity of the universality hypothesis in these and many other settings, a fundamental understanding of these phenomena is still lacking, particularly in the case of interacting systems. \\n\\nThis project will investigate several key problems, representative of different instances of universality. It will develop along three inter-connected research lines: scaling limits in Ising and dimer models, quantum transport in interacting Fermi systems, continuous symmetry breaking in spin systems and in models for pattern formation or nematic order. Progresses on these problems will come from an effective combination of the complementary techniques that are currently used in the mathematical theory of universality, such as: constructive renormalization group, reflection positivity, functional inequalities, discrete harmonic analysis, rigidity estimates. We will pay particular attention to the study of some poorly understood aspects of the theory, such as the role of boundary corrections, the loss of translational invariance in multiscale analysis, and the phenomenon of continuous non-abelian symmetry breaking. The final goal of the project is the development of new tools for the mathematical analysis of strongly interacting systems. Its impact will be an improved fundamental understanding of universality phenomena in condensed matter.',\n",

This market standard is central to efficiency.\\n\\nThe problem\\nWhile the infrastructure is established and well-functioning, the efficiency is decreasing in recent years resulting in higher CO2 costs and inefficient marginal cost per pallet.\\nThe efficiency is decreasing as weight per pallet is decreasing; leaving unused weight & volume potential as most trucks can carry more weight & volume than what is currently loaded. The main issue is the lack of floor space, and that pallets are not easily stacked on top of each other, leaving unused volume in the top space of the truck.\\n\\nOur solution \\nThe solution is an extension of the present EURO pallet technology to accommodate the decrease in cargo weight. SpaceInvader ApS has developed a multilayers pallet stacking system, called the SpaceInvader. \\nCombined with existing equipment, the SpaceInvader enable pallets to be stacked in two layers and thereby use the free top space capacity available in 80-90 % of all truck transportations. \\nThe potential value of the solution for transportation companies is very high, as the sector makes revenue and compete on very low marginal costs. By being able to fully optimize the load of their trucks, transportation companies become more competitive, and can reduce their carbon footprint by simply having to drive fewer times in order to deliver the same amount of goods. \\nBased on initial input from large test customers (ASKO, SuperGros, Danske Fragtmænd), we have chosen a business model where a set of SpaceInvaders will be rented out for 65 € a month. The expected value for the transportation company is 260 € a month, meaning the cost of renting a set of SpaceInvaders will be covered after just one week of use.',\n",
       " 'Bladder Cancer (BC) is the costlier cancer type to manage, characterized by high recurrence and progression rates. Despite recent advancements, current BC therapeutic strategies remain suboptimal, mostly due to the disease molecular heterogeneity. Profiling at the transcriptomics and, very recently, proteomics levels, revealed the existence of a cross-omics conserved molecular signature marking progression from low to high risk non muscle invasive (NMIBC) and eventually muscle invasive disease. ReDrugBC targets to identify drugs, via drug repurposing, able to revert the aggressive molecular signature for NMIBC, hence tackling the disease at an earlier stage and on a more holistic manner. To address this state-of-the-art concept, ReDrugBC is divided into three highly interrelated strategic points: 1) drug identification (among existing compounds) for NMIBC based on the existent tissue molecular profiles analyzed in a multi-layer and multi-omics manner using specialized bioinformatics-drug prediction tools, 2) definition of impact of selected drugs on the functional properties of BC cell lines in vitro and 3) characterization and understanding of the drug impact on a molecular level, via the application of high-throughput proteomics analysis. This research program will be carried out in a research intensive SME-leader in clinical proteomics and multi-dimensional analysis, by a very active and promising young researcher originating from academia, in a multidisciplinary, implementation-oriented manner. Outreach activities include among others links to pharmaceutical companies and regulators to accelerate progress towards (pre-) clinical trials post-ReDrugBC. Collectively, the proposed approach in ReDrugBC paves the way for better treatment of NMIBC via drug selection based on the patient molecular signatures, while offering unique inter-sectorial training on translational research to a highly motivated young female researcher.',\n",

Surprisingly, all of this hinges on a cognitive ability whose evolutionary origins are largely unknown: the ability to recognize disease in others. Under the mentorship of Dr Joanna Setchell (Durham University), a world-leading expert in primate disease signalling, Dr Sharon Kessler (fellow) will test her novel hypothesis that disease recognition evolved in associate with social cognition the primate order before the divergence of the human lineage. This multidisciplinary project integrates anthropology, psychology, and parasitology to test 1) whether a nonhuman primate signals infection status using visual, acoustic, and olfactory cues, 2) whether primates use these cues to recognize disease in others, and 3) whether disease recognition correlates with accepted measures of primate social cognition. The objectives will be achieved by taking photos, recording vocalisations, and collecting odour samples from semi-free ranging mandrills, Mandrillus sphinx, at the Centre International de Recherches Médicales mandrill colony in Gabon before and after treatment with anti-parasite medications.

Performances on these disease recognition tests will be compared with performances in social cognition on the state-of-the-art Primate Cognition Test Battery. This innovative, multidisciplinary study increases the international networks of the participants, provides Kessler with cutting edge training, and breaks new ground on the role of disease in the evolution of primate, including human, cognition.',\n",

Tethered neural recordings have been, so far, the virtually unique methodology available for these studies. Nonetheless, this approach 1) limits the range of behaviours and functions that can be investigated, 2) reduces the ecological validity of the results and 3) increases the public ethical concerns about the use of NHP, challenging the future of this still fundamental branch of science. \\nThis project (FUTURE-NHP) capitalizes on the preliminary findings of the ERCstg grant WIRELESS, in which we are developing a new approach to brain studies in freely-moving NHP with wireless technologies and video behavioural monitoring.

       " 'Gene therapy using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors has shown early promise in clinical trials. The therapeutic transgene cassette can be packaged in different AAV capsid pseudotypes, each having a unique transduction profile. At present, AAV capsid serotype selection for a specific clinical trial is based on effectiveness in small animal models. We (and others) have shown substantial progress in improving gene therapy for eye diseases in rodents. However, small animal studies are not often predictive of human outcome when it comes to the efficacy of viral delivery. Moreover, non-human primates used as pre-clinical animal models do not display any pathology making them unsuitable for testing efficacy. Here, I propose to overcome these bottlenecks in translational gene therapy by generating non-human primate models of retinal degeneration where effects of therapies and prosthesis on sight restoration can be tested. Generating transgenic primates using germline transgenesis would be very costly and ethically problematic. I thus propose to induce retinal disease locally, following delivery of pathogenic genes within specific subsets of cells in the non-human primate retina (Aim A). In Aim B, I propose to develop novel AAVs for use in human gene therapy using directed evolution. This bioengineering approach has yielded AAVs with enhanced delivery properties in the murine retina and applying it to post-mortem human retinas will generate AAVs responding to a clinical need in gene therapy. All together, the creation of models of disease in primates combined with novel AAVs tested in human post-mortem retinas will enable us to validate therapies aiming at vision restoration and neuroprotection in retinas with a macula and high central visual acuity, removing a major roadblock in the development of ocular therapeutics for humans.',\n",

       " 'Human beings have been credited with unparalleled capabilities for digital prehension grasping. However, given the single evolutionary origin of humans and the unique anatomical features they possess, quantitative tests of evolutionary scenarios remain difficult. Moreover, functional inferences based on fragmentary fossil material are often problematic. However, grasping behavior is widespread among tetrapods, thus providing an excellent context for testing hypotheses concerning the origin of manipulation and grasping. The propensity to grasp, and the anatomical characteristics that underlie it, appear in all of the major groups of tetrapods. Although some features are common to all tetrapods, other features, such as opposable digits and tendon morphology, appear to have evolved independently in many lineages. Although recent papers have reviewed the state of the art on grasping, a holistic study including the whole forelimb and its behavioral context in locomotion and manipulation is currently lacking. The goal of the present project is to provide an integrative approach that examines the occurrence of grasping behavior, the anatomy and function of the forelimb, and the evolution of grasping across the three major tetrapod clades that show manual grasping abilities: mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Within each clade I will compare and contrast the use of the forelimb, its anatomy, and its function in both arboreal and terrestrial animals to test the hypothesis of an arboreal origin of grasping and manipulation capacity. I will study the use of the hand and the forelimb in the context of locomotion and object/food manipulation to understand the relations between anatomy, function and ecology. To do so, I will use state-of-the-art approaches to quantify the anatomy (µCT scanning, 3D geometric morphometrics), the function (pressure and force measurements, 3D kinematics and biomechanical models), and the evolution of these traits in an explicit phylogenetic context.',\n",

Some have claimed that this turn-taking system is uniquely human5,6, but others argue that it provides the evolutionary ‘missing link’ between animal and human communication7. This debate has been constrained by a lack of comparative data, methodological confounds that often prevent meaningful comparisons, and a lack of information on key components of social relationships8,9 that might strongly impact upon turn-taking propensities. \\nObjectives. TURNTAKING will quantify turn-taking production and comprehension in human children, chimpanzees, and two distantly related species — geladas and common marmosets. It will apply a powerful combination of systematic behavioral observations, eye-tracking paradigms, and established measures from Conversational Analysis3,10 and Primatology9 that allow the same type of data to be collected and analyzed in directly comparable ways across species. This will provide the first rigorous test of whether cooperative turn-taking is uniquely human, ancestral in the primate lineage, or evolved independently in different species. TURNTAKING will identify which hallmarks of human turn-taking are shared across different primate species, and which key components of relationship quality8,9 act upon turn-taking skills. \\nOutcomes. This project will found the field of comparative turn-taking, and provide pioneering insights into the behavioral flexibility underlying different turn-taking systems. It will go beyond the state of the art by exposing whether cooperative turn-taking is the evolutionary ‘missing link’ between our species and our inarticulate primate cousins, and whether pro-social behaviors drove its emergence.',\n",
       " 'A number of studies demonstrated that the primates’ premotor cortex (PM) plays a crucial role not only in organizing movement, but also in perceptual and socio-cognitive functions. However, these studies have been carried out in laboratory settings, which deeply limit the possibility to understand the neural mechanisms underlying natural behaviours. To solve this problem, I propose a new approach consisting in a two-steps chronic recording of monkey PM neurons: first, single neurons response properties will be characterized in a traditional, head-restrained laboratory setting; then, in the same session, the same neurons activity will be recorded wirelessly during free interactions of the monkey with its physical and social environment. The project will initially focus on neurons belonging to the forelimb representation of the ventral (i.e. areas F4 and F5) and dorsal (area F2vr) PM, putatively well known for their role in sensorimotor transformations, goal coding, representation of space, and recognition of other’s observed actions. The same paradigm will then be applied to the study of the mesial pre-supplementary area F6, a crucial bridge between prefrontal and PM regions whose role in socio-cognitive functions remains still virtually unknown. Finally, by simultaneous, chronic recording of neuronal activity from lateral and mesial PM, we will first assess the functional interactions between these areas in both laboratory and natural settings, and then we will probe causality in these interactions by chemically manipulating neuronal activity of one region (i.e. F6) while recording from the other one (i.e. F5). The project will reveal the role of premotor cortex in motor and social functions during natural behaviours. In addition, it might open up new possibilities for future studies of neural plasticity and reorganization of ethologically-relevant motor, cognitive and social functions following chemical manipulation of neural activity and virtual brain lesions.',\n",
       " 'Empathy – sharing and understanding others’ emotions and thoughts – is a defining feature of what it means to be human. However, we lack knowledge about the origins of empathy and to what extent its sub-components reflect species and cultural universals. Studying infants and great apes enables us to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy and the extent of its human uniqueness. Until now, it has largely been assumed that infants and great apes lack the capacity for empathy. However, this claim may reflect a lack of adequate methodologies and research attention, leaving infant and great ape empathy underestimated. Now, combining novel techniques to investigate empathy comparatively (thermal-imaging, pupillometry and eye-tracking) with longitudinal observations and innovative experiments, EMPORIGIN will overcome this issue to provide the first comparative investigation of empathy development in humans and bonobos, our closest living relatives. Rich datasets on bonobo (wild and semi-captive) infant development and caregiver interactions will be compared to those from human infants in two small-scale, traditional societies – Vanuatu and Samoa. Both societies show distributed-caregiving but vary in societal structure and emotional expressivity. Using a cross-species and cross-cultural approach, EMPORIGIN will deliver step-change insights into empathy development that go far beyond the State-of-the-Art. We will test the hypothesis that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but humans diverge in a greater motivation to ameliorate others’ emotional states and a capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange. These capacities could lead to a cascade of human-unique forms of sharing and co-operation. Combining approaches across biology, psychology, ethology and anthropology, EMPORIGIN will advance our understanding of the origins of empathy, one of our most remarkable capacities, and challenge current perspectives about its human uniqueness.',\n",
       " 'Of 504 primate species currently recognized worldwide, almost half are classified as endangered or critically endangered. Captive breeding is vital for primate conservation, with modern zoos serving a crucial role as ambassadors of endangered species, breeders of populations acting as buffers against extinction, and educators of the general public. However, captive populations may experience welfare issues that also undermine their breeding success. Particularly, zoo management is challenging because of the mismatch between natural and captive environments. The aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) is the only surviving species of the Daubentoniidae, the oldest family of the living lemurs, one of the 25 most endangered primates in the world, and currently showing a low success rate in captive breeding. This multi-zoo project aims to identify and reproduce the female aye-aye’s fertile chemical signature and then test its effects on the breeding success and welfare of three captive troops. We will meet these goals using methods that integrate cutting-edge semiochemistry with established behavioural observations and faecal endocrinology as well as innovative faecal gut microbiota analysis. This novel project will provide findings which should also entail quantifiable impact, such as best practices adopted by target zoos and extended to other institutions through amendments in management policies released by the Studbook Keeper and the Taxon Advisory Group Coordinator for the study species. The complementary expertise of the Fellow and the supervisory team make this project feasible and highly multidisciplinary. The training provided by the supervisor and the host organisation will contribute significantly to the profile of the Fellow, adding new methodological and scientific competences as well as complementary skills which will be imperative for the Fellow’s future career as an independent researcher.',\n",
       " 'This project enters the experimental investigation of anyonic quantum gases. We will study anyons – conjectured particles with a statistical exchange phase anywhere between 0 and π – in different many-body systems. This progress will be enabled by a unique approach of bringing together artificial gauge fields and quantum gas microscopes for ultracold atoms.\\n\\nSpecifically, we will implement the 1D anyon Hubbard model via a lattice shaking protocol that imprints density-dependent Peierls phases. By engineering the statistical exchange phase, we can continuously tune between bosons and fermions and explore a statistically-induced quantum phase transition. We will monitor the continuous fermionization via the build-up of Friedel oscillations. Using state-of-the-art cold atom technology, we will thus open the physics of anyons to experimental research and address open questions related to their fractional exclusion statistics.\\n\\nSecondly, we will create fractional quantum Hall systems in rapidly rotating microtraps. Using the quantum gas microscope, we will i) control the optical potentials at a level which allows approaching the centrifugal limit and ii) use small atom numbers equal to the inserted angular momentum quantum number. The strongly-correlated ground states such as the Laughlin state can be identified via their characteristic density correlations. Of particular interest are the quasihole excitations, whose predicted anyonic exchange statistics have not been directly observed to date. We will probe and test their statistics via the characteristic counting sequence in the excitation spectrum. Furthermore, we will test ideas to transfer anyonic properties of the excitations to a second tracer species. This approach will enable us to both probe the fractional exclusion statistics of the excitations and to create a 2D anyonic quantum gas. \\n\\nIn the long run, these techniques open a path to also study non-Abelian anyons with ultracold atoms.',\n",
       " 'In this project I will study the generation, detection, and interaction with matter of Flying Toroids, a new type of light pulses never experimentally studied before. This represents an exciting opportunity to advance optics and electromagnetism in a radically new direction since Hertz, Marconi, Popov and Tesla developed technology for generating, detecting, and communicating with transverse electromagnetic waves. \\n\\nConventional transverse electromagnetic waves propagate in free-space with the electric and magnetic field vectors perpendicular to the wave propagation direction, forming the famous triad. Theoretical analysis of recent years has shown that another, very different type of waves exists, which propagate at the speed of light, but only occur as short bursts of electromagnetic energy in the form of Flying Toroids. Flying Toroids are inseparable solutions of Maxwell equations with a unique, doughnut-like configuration of the electric and magnetic fields.  Flying Toroids interact with matter in unique ways, drastically different from that of conventional electromagnetic pulses. \\n\\nIn a broader context, the electrodynamics of Flying Toroids is an exciting emerging field of optical science linked to intriguing recent developments in physics such as toroidal dipoles and anapoles, and, due to their topology, to Majorana fermions and skyrmions. \\n\\nBuilding on my recent proof-of-principle demonstration of Flying Toroid generation through conversion of few-cycle conventional transverse light pulses in artificial photonic nanostructures, my goal for this project is to experimentally study and understand the fundamental properties of Flying Toroids and their interaction with matter at optical frequencies, and to assess their potential for developing new technologies.

Effects of nanoengineering on the regulation of the hydration and hardening processes of aluminosilicate-based cementitious binders for sustainable constructions, as well as its roles on the solidification/stabilization of aluminosilicate-based grains/wastes for environmental protection will be explored. Nanoengineering will be utilized for preparing low-carbon cementitious materials containing of different sources of Aluminosilicates, Carbonates and Sulfates (ACS) binders for sustainable construction. The hydration kinetics and performance of ACS binders will be tailored through the optimization of a combination of cement and minor ions (such as Mg, Fe, Cl). The mechanical properties and durability will be systematically studied for evaluation of performance. Secondly, effects of nanoengineering on S/S of typical aluminosilicate-based grains/wastes for environmental protection will be investigated. Solidification/stabilization using nanoengineered aluminosilicates will be studied and modelled thermodynamically. Cases such as solidification/stabilization of soil/construction wastes, mining wastes will be researched, and the environment features, such as the solidification capability, the leachability of the wastes will be investigated through mechanical testing and sequential extraction procedures (SEP), etc. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) will be used for a comprehensive understanding of the sustainability of the production and utilization of the new binders, baselined against Portland cement by taking the transportation, production, usage, and recycling stages into consideration.

       " 'Analyses of surface deformation can help to define the evolution of areas, structures and infrastructures menaced by hazardous phenomena. To this end, space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data provides direct measures of surface movements. Specific techniques to handle SAR data have been recently applied to monitor not only natural hazardous phenomena, such as earthquakes, subsidence and landslides, but even structural health of buildings and infrastructure. The large spread of these techniques is supported by the non-invasiveness of radar signals, the possibility to cover vast areas and the availability of a large database of data acquired since the ‘90s, despite they do not give any indication about the triggering factors and the strain source or the tensile condition of a structure. STEADY Project (SaTEllyte synthetic Aperture radar interferometry to model Dam stability) is aimed to use SAR data to monitor dam structural health and, even more, to apply an innovative approach, exploiting deformation fields as a starting point to re-create a simplified analytical model, providing preliminary hints about the stress-strain status of the dam in a short time if compared with traditional finite element models. The relevance of this process emerges when environmental or logistic conditions do not allow to monitor dams through traditional geodetic and numerical techniques. In such cases, results obtained from SAR data combined with an analytical model constitute a reliable diagnostic tool of dam structural health to avoid any extraordinary failure that may lead to loss of lives. The method will be tested on an emblematic real case, the Mosul dam, facing the following goals: (i) analysis of satellite SAR data available over the area, (ii) identification of an analytical model to reproduce dam deformation behaviour and tensile condition, (iii) implementation of a semi-automatic tool to perform numerical simulations, applicable to further cases.',\n",

Having to design a designated space just for the garbage storage on board has always been a pain for the ship designers who have to deal with functionality and efficiency of every square meter of the ship space. Along the years, the industry has tried to deal with this problem in several ways, but none have given a good solution, and many of them do not satisfy the strict IMO requirements \\nSANITRADE S.r.l. is an Italian SME that provides solutions to the confined space waste and waste water management problems. One of their products, SANISHREDDER has a potential to solve the address some problems on the ship waste management market, but it does not solve the automatization of the entire waste storage to be able to gain in space, energy savings, labour and decrease a health hazards. This is how they came up with SANISTABILIZER. \\nSANISTABILIZER is a product that incorporates shredding, dewatering, sanitation and transportation devices. SANISTABILIZER is a complex device that allows treatment of any kind of domestic waste produced on board, will the outcome product can be safely stored without temperature control, can be directly handled and disposed at the ships arrival to its destination. SANISTABILIZER main advantages are: no need of energy use for the mixed food and waste storage (70% reduction), reduction of the disposal costs (50%) due to weight (70%) and volume reduction (80-95%) and no risk of the dioxins combustion. \\nSANISTABILIZER’s commercialisation will enhance SANITRADE’s growth by increasing our turnover to €12 million by the fifth year with a ROI of 3.8.',\n",
       " 'The enhancement of an engine operability involves increasing the compressor surge margin which is still an open challenge. \\nThe project FLORA (FLOw control in RAdial compressor) is twofold.\\nFirst, it proposes to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the transient behavior of the radial compressor delivered by the Topic Leader through a precise characterization of the instabilities which develop at various rotation speeds and at different IGV (Inlet Guide Vanes) stagger angles. Detailed experimental investigations are planned providing an improved and time-resolved description of the path to surge.\\nThen, it proposes to apply passive flow control strategies in order to push back the compressor surge line towards low mass flow which will consequently enhance the compressor stability, hence the engine operability. The proposal particularly aims at evaluating the benefits from the boundary layer aspiration in radial geometries in terms of performance (gain in pressure ratio and efficiency) and surge margin. Besides experiments, calculations will help for the understanding of the internal flow structures which develop from stable operating points up to surge.  High-fidelity Large Eddy Simulations (LES) will be used to get an in-depth comprehension of the impact of the flow control on the internal flow.\\nThe project FLORA will contribute to the development of stable and efficient radial compressors with extended operating range.',\n",

These Ultra-High Bypass Ratio (UHBR) engines have large fans rotating at relatively low speeds. As a consequence of the lower speed, the fuel consumption can be reduced. Another consequence is that the engine noise signature is modified. While jet noise and fan noise will be reduced, core noise will be become more significant.

       " \"'The application of an external electric field has proven to be a very effective way of controlling combustion. Laboratory test cases have shown that this technology is capable of controlling many aspects of premixed and non-premixed combustion in small burners as well as in industrial-scale systems. However, the fundamental aspects of this interaction between a reacting flow and an electric field remain mostly unknown and this prevents the application of this technology in industrial applications. The complexity of the required models and the large computational cost associated with the simulation of the electric response of a flame to an electric field have so far limited the numerical analysis of this type fo flows to one-dimensional and two-dimensional configurations taking into account only laminar flames. Considering that most of the industrial burners are operated in the turbulent regime, it appears necessary to shed light on the behavior of electrified flames at high Reynolds number. In this context, the present project proposes to study the behavior of a turbulent reacting mixing layer impinged by an external electric field using a detailed description of the reacting and transport phenomena involved in this flow. The calculation of this complex configuration will be allowed by the use of the parallel computing paradigm proposed with the 'Regent' programming language recently developed at Stanford University. The result of these calculations will allow me to extensively define the modification induced by the imposed electric field on the thermochemical fields produced in the turbulent reacting layer as well as the impact of the electric force on the statistical properties of the turbulence. Moreover, the database obtained with these calculations will be used as a benchmark solution for the development and validation of a reduced-order model necessary for the calculation of electrified reacting flows in industrial applications.'\",\n",
       " 'This project is focused on the fundamental problem of combustion dynamics that has many practical implications. It specifically considers annular systems like those used in land based gas turbines and aeroengines. The corresponding combustors feature new architectures that reduce pollutant NOx emissions to comply with increasingly stringent regulations. However, these new designs and the essentially lean premixed mode they employ also promote a resonant coupling between combustion and acoustic modes. These combustion instabilities have many detrimental effects leading in extreme cases to mechanical failure. Despite the large number of investigations concerning instabilities arising with premixed flames yet few are the studies dealing with cases where the fuel is injected as a spray. Furthermore, the limited availability of engine data is a further obstacle for these studies in a real combustor. The present project aims to fill this gap of knowledge by proposing combined numerical and experimental investigations on spray flame dynamics and spray flame coupling with azimuthal modes in annular systems. The project first focuses on the analysis of the nonlinear response of a single spray flame to incoming acoustic perturbations via Large Eddy Simulations. The study is then extended to a multiple swirl spray injector injector system to investigate the impact on the flame response of the interaction between multiple adjacent flames. Numerical results are compared with experiments carried out in unique facilities available at EM2C Laboratory including the annular MICCA-Spray combustor. Theoretical and numerical procedures involving advanced coupling of the combustor acoustics with the obtained flame responses are developed to predict the limit cycles observed during experiments. Finally, the combustion dynamics observed experimentally in a Safran Aircraft Engine combustor will be investigated to verify the transferability of the developed techniques to a full-scale system.',\n",

For decades, this has been achieved by trapping ions with radiofrequency (rf) fields and neutral particles with optical fields. Our group demonstrated the trapping of ions by interaction with light. We see these results and our proposal as starting point for finally combining the advantages of optical trapping and ions. In particular, ions provide individual addressability, high fidelities of operations and long-range Coulomb interaction, significantly larger compared to those of atoms and molecules\\nThe aim of this proposal is to (i) study and establish optically trapping of ions and atoms in general, to (ii) demonstrate the substantial improvement of our approach in the context of interaction and reaction at ultra-low temperatures and to (iii) explore further perspectives by adapting methodology of quantum optics to gain control and state-sensitive detection on the level of individual quanta within the merged ion-atom system. \\nThe field of ultra cold chemistry is perfectly suited as a showcase for this purpose. We will embed optically trapped ions into quantum degenerate gases to reach temperatures, 4-5 orders of magnitude below the current state of the art. Our approach circumvents the currently inevitable excess kinetic energy in hybrid traps, where ions are kept but also driven by rf-fields. It permits to enter the temperature regime where quantum effects are predicted to dominate, (i) in many-body physics, including the potential formation and dynamics of mesoscopic clusters of atoms of a Bose-Einstein-Condensate, binding to the “impurity ion”, as well as (ii) the subsequent two-particle s-wave collisions, the ultimate limit in ultra-cold chemistry.\\n\\nFurther development of our novel and generic tools for “quantum engineering can be expected to propel several other striving fields of research, such as, experimental quantum simulations',\n",
       " 'Volcanic hazards directly affect more than 10% of the world’s population, and have caused globally significant economic losses as recently as 2010. Accurate eruption frequencies are fundamental to risk management, and well-dated volcanic events can temporally link archaeological sites and palaeoclimatic records across hundreds of kilometres. Yet there are significant, known gaps in records of prehistoric volcanic cycles, and accurate luminescence ages for volcanic features would be of great value in future studies. However, volcanic products are mineralogically complex with some crystals producing inaccurate ages. We propose exploring and developing an innovative luminescence technique (‘spatially resolved luminescence’, ‘SRL’) to date volcanic events. SRL uses an ultra-sensitive camera to image luminescence, so that signals can be easily compared with accompanying experimental data (e.g. mineral type or signal stability measurements). This project utilizes luminescence imaging at multiple wavelengths (‘hyperspectral’) and mineralogical analyses to accurately date volcanic ejecta with mixed mineralogy. It builds on the expertise of the supervisor and experienced researcher (‘ER’) in luminescence dating and imaging as well as statistical data analysis, and enhances the ER’s skill set via training in volcanology, the development of analytical software, and the German language and culture. The ER will draw together an international network of leading scientists in industry (Freiberg Instruments) and academia (Universities of Freiburg, Bern, Oxford), allowing her to substantially enhance her leadership skills. As a subsidiary outcome, this project will also increase the European capacity in multiple connected fields, including composite strain analysis (aerospace) and detection of irradiated foods (food standards authorities).',\n",

The main objective of the study is a reinvestigation of literary history and cultural policy of the PRC from the perspective of the ordinary reader. This grassroots approach is innovative in the writing of Chinese literary history as it means turning away from the established focus on authors and the political context. Instead, READCHINA will investigate the social conditions under which texts were read, what influences this had on the lives of individuals, on social, intellectual and literary change in China, and on the modes of production, distribution and consumption of literature.\\nREADCHINA considers the reading of literature as part of a wider web of reading materials, including different media and non-fictional texts. Primary sources will consist among others of archival material, field work interviews, autobiographies, marketing materials, statements by fans in online forums, and literary texts. Combining literary analysis with historical and ethnographical inquiry, as well as methods from the digital humanities, READCHINA will contribute to the fields of literary history and literary sociology. Moreover, in combining close readings of texts with distant reading methods, READCHINA will also foster our understanding of the meaning and impact of popular literature in China and of literary theories on reading. READCHINA will thus bring 20th and 21st century China into the global history of reading – especially so, as practices of reading in China have been shaped by different institutions than in the ‘West’: a Socialist State eager to reform its citizens by means of cultural policies, a centralized bureaucratic system regulating distribution and access to reading matters, and a highly efficient system of media control.',\n",

       " 'SVCTs are Sodium-dependent Vitamin C Transporters, part of the large solute carrier protein family (SLC), and are the major carriers for Vitamin C uptake and regulation. Abnormal Vitamin C regulation has been associated with several diseases, including cancer, obesity, hypertension, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, Vitamin C attenuates oxidative stress caused by alcohol consumption while continuous Vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy. Despite their importance, Vitamin C uptake and regulation are poorly understood.\\n\\nIn humans, SVCTs include two important classes, SVCT1 and SVCT2, that belong to a family of membrane-embedded, phosphorylation-dependent glycoproteins with an overall 65% sequence identity. Specifically, SVCT1 is expressed on the epithelia of hepatic, intestinal and renal tissues, presenting low affinity and high capacity for Vitamin C, having an important role in regulation of whole body homeostasis. SVCT2, on the other hand, exhibits high affinity and low capacity, and is expressed in most cells and tissues where its function is the delivery of Vitamin C to cells as a cofactor for major enzyme pathways protecting from oxidative stress. To date, the structural basis for the mechanism of action of SVCTs remains largely unexplored.\\n\\nHere, we aim at unraveling the mechanism of Vitamin C transport and regulation by determining the three-dimensional structures of both SVCT1 and SVCT2, thereby providing mechanistic understanding of the different activities of these transporters. We will use a multidisciplinary approach of high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography and biophysical methods to understand SVCT function and interactions. This work will contribute to elucidating the mechanism of Vitamin C transport by SVCTs and may ultimately lead to drug discovery.',\n",

       " 'How do cortical circuits process sensory stimuli that leads to perception? Sensory input is encoded by complex interactions between principal excitatory neurons and a diverse population of inhibitory cells. Distinct inhibitory neurons control different subcellular domains of target principal neurons, suggesting specific roles of different cells during sensory processing. However, the individual contribution of these inhibitory subtypes to sensory processing remains poorly understood. This is mainly due to the technical challenges of recording the activity of identified cell types in-vivo, in response to quantified sensory stimuli. Therefore, I propose a novel approach based on four pillars: 1) An optically accessible circuit in the superficial layers of the cortex, comprised of inhibitory cells expressing the serotonin receptor 5HT3a, and the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. 2) A novel combination of electrophysiology and 3D two-photon imaging to simultaneously record the activity of morphologically identified 5HT3a cells and their dendritic targets. 3) A head-fixed perceptual decision task, whereby mice use their whiskers to determine the location of an object, allowing an accurate description of the sensory stimulus. 4) The integration of experimental data and computer models to gain mechanistic insights into circuit functions. The 5HT3a cells and the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons receive ‘top-down’ contextual information from other cortical areas that is essential for constructing meaningful perceptions of sensory stimuli. Thus I hypothesize that 5HT3a cells influence sensory perceptions by controlling the excitability of the pyramidal cell distal dendrites that integrate top-down and sensory input. Thus, I will not only reveal novel functions of inhibitory neurons, I will also shed light on how top-down and sensory input is integrated, and I will provide novel methods to test the functions of other cell types in normal mice and disease models.',\n",
       " 'The literature approaches the authoritarian turn in Turkish politics either as an example of political Islam gone wrong or as part of the competitive authoritarianism that sweep across the globe. But even a cursory glance reveals the persistence and recurrence of authoritarian themes in Turkish political discourse regardless of religious leaning. How, then, can we talk about cultural underpinnings of authoritarian rule in Turkey without succumbing to cultural essentialism or presenting it as a sui generis case?  Accordingly, this project aims to explore the historical transformation of an authoritarian and messianic concept of leadership in Turkish context from the mid-nineteenth century to present. Parallel to this the project will look at how such concepts are tied to the various temporalities, that is, alternative ways the past, the present and the future are represented and imagined politically. Employing a conceptual historical approach with an innovative research design, this project will be a cultural archeology of the authoritarian turn in Turkish politics and follow the Islamic and secular political theologies both of which imagine the leader as a savior figure in a state of crisis and exception. The project uses the word Messianism to define this authoritarian concept of leadership, because besides the obvious savior image of the ruler and attending concepts, the project will focus on religious and secular temporalities that are implied by, or built into, such concepts. These temporalities include national liberation, Muslim revival and material development all of which propose different narratives of Ottoman decline and fall, posit a set of enemies and threats and imagine a future where these threats are thwarted and community reaches a state of peace and security. Within such temporalities the leader emerges as a supreme agency which is able to interfere in the history and change its course.',\n",

It is a common, pervasive and devastating illness characterised by persistent episodes of low mood. Depression affects individuals across all geographical locations and by the year 2030 it will be the largest contributor to disease burden worldwide. Depression that occurs in women during pregnancy and post-partum is referred to as maternal depression (MD). MD is the leading cause of perinatal mortality and it accounts for ∼20% of all postpartum deaths.  Despite this profound individual and societal burden, the aetiology of depression remains poorly understood in part, due to three research barriers: 1) lack of success in identifying genetic variants specific to MD 2) inadequate account of environmental risk factors in genetic research and 3) heterogeneity. GenGeoRisk will address each of these research barriers in the following ways: 1) I will use aggregates of genetic variants (polygenic scores) derived from other successful studies of psychiatric traits to calculate genetic p—a general dimension, which sits at the top of a hierarchical structure of psychopathological dimensions and captures one’s general liability to psychopathology. Genetic p will be used to predict MD symptom risk and resilience in the world’s largest (N= 240 000) pregnancy cohort (MoBa; the Norwegian, mother, father and offspring cohort study) 2) I will use geographical location data from the entire Norwegian population (> 7 000 000) that has been recently linked to MoBa data to illuminate how MD symptoms and genetic p vary across neighbourhoods and diverse Norwegian municipalities  3) I will focus on MD, a less heterogeneous form of major depression, and use genetic p to discover MD subtypes. GenGeoRisk will be the first intergenerational, multi-environmental and DNA based investigation of MD to date.',\n",

Apocrypha is here defined as (1) texts and traditions that develop or expand upon characters and events of the biblical storyworld; (2) and/or contain a claim to authorship by a character from that storyworld or a direct witness to it. A great number of such apocryphal texts and traditions has been preserved in Coptic manuscripts from the fourth to the twelfth centuries. Most of these texts are attributed to apostles or other important early Christian figures, and over time such materials were also increasingly embedded in pseudepigraphical frames, such as in homilies attributed to later, but still early, heroes of the Church. The manuscripts in which this literature has been preserved were almost exclusively produced and used in Egyptian monasteries. Although the use of such apocrypha were at times controversial, the evidence clearly indicates the widespread use of such literature in Coptic monasteries over centuries, and this project will investigate the contents, development, and functions of apocrypha over time, as they were copied, adapted, and used in changing socio-religious contexts over time. The period covered by the project saw drastic changes in the religious landscape of Egypt, from its Christianity having a dominant position in the fourth century, through the marginalization of Egyptian Christianity in relation to the imperial Chalcedonian Church after 451, to a period of increasing marginalization in relation to Islam following the Arab conquest of Egypt in the mid-seventh century. The project will investigate how these changing contexts are reflected in the Coptic apocrypha that were copied and used in Egyptian monasteries, and what functions they had for their users throughout the period under investigation.',\n",

       " 'As the opioid epidemic escalates, we must ask: why are opioids so addictive? Non-human animal research links addiction with the powerful relief opioids can offer to animals in distress. In humans, epidemiological and clinical studies converge upon social stressors and a poor social support network as key risk factors for addiction. Despite this, it is currently unknown how pre-drug distress might alter opioid drug effects. Tremendous resources are dedicated to charting how people feel after taking a drug, sidestepping the potentially profound influence of how people feel before they take the drug. Here, I will turn the current approach on its head. Using acute social distress induction before morphine administration in healthy humans, I will create a human model to determine the psychological, physiological and brain underpinnings of how social stressors increase opioids’ abuse liability.\\n\\nFirst, I will test the hypothesis that pre-drug distress enhances drug wanting (self-administration) but not drug liking (self-report) compared to drug effects in a control condition. Second, I will use opioid blockade to confirm or falsify the hypothesis that opioid drugs ‘hijack’ brain mechanisms underpinning social support. Third, I will determine to what extent opioid drug effects are dopamine-dependent by blocking dopamine before morphine administration. I will also apply computational modelling and functional imaging to elucidate the underlying brain mechanisms. Thus, the proposal offers a powerful new methodology for resolving hotly debated questions on the independent contributions of opioids and dopamine for reward and abuse liability.\\n\\nIn sum, the project aims to achieve a breakthrough in our understanding of how a pre-drug social distress state can alter opioid drug mechanisms. The mechanistic understanding arising from this project could have profound implications for science, as well as for clinical care and new policies designed to contain the opioid epidemic.',\n",

The ambitious aims of the present proposal are two-fold: \\n(1) Use recent advances in memory consolidation theory to achieve an elaborate model of episodic memory deficits in aging\\n(2) Use aging as a model to uncover how structural and functional brain changes affect episodic memory consolidation in general\\nThe novelty of the project lies in the synthesis of recent methodological advances and theoretical models for episodic memory consolidation to explain age-related decline, by employing a unique combination of a range of different techniques and approaches. This is ground-breaking, in that it aims at taking our understanding of the brain processes underlying episodic memory decline in aging to a new level, while at the same time advancing our theoretical understanding of how episodic memories are consolidated in the human brain. To obtain this outcome, I will test the main hypothesis of the project: Brain processes of episodic memory consolidation are less effective in older adults, and this can account for a significant portion of the episodic memory decline in aging. This will be answered by six secondary hypotheses, with 1-3 experiments or tasks designated to address each hypothesis, focusing on functional and structural MRI, positron emission tomography data and sleep experiments to target consolidation from different angles.',\n",
       " 'Climate change will disrupt current political, societal and economic paradigms. What should a just territorial arrangement be for countries that will partially or totally disappear due to sea level rise, or whose main productive activities—like farming—will be lost due to changed weather patterns? How to think of “locals” and “migrants” in a world where climate refugees are estimated to reach up to one billion by 2050? How should Global Systemic Resources (GSRs), like rainforests, be governed to guarantee their maintenance?\\nIn a post-Holocene world where sea level rise, desertification, droughts, crop failure, water shortage, floods and extreme weather events will become the norm, we need normative criteria to solve conflicts of interest regarding the use of land and natural resources. DynamiTE aims to provide those criteria, developing a novel framework for territory on a global scale, reassessing the traditional rights and duties associated with it.\\nWhile current normative theories of territory (NTTs) rely on Late Holocene assumptions (stable and predictable climate, geography and demographics), DynamiTE theorizes territory amidst instability and unpredictability. While current NTTs draw their main normative assumptions from the Western liberal canon—e.g., that property rights over land and natural resources secure justice—DynamiTE questions their adequacy now and in the future.\\nDynamiTE conceptualizes territory and territorial agency as dynamic, with shifting boundaries and shifting memberships that reflect this new complexity. It proposes moreover a dynamic, interdisciplinary methodology that integrates environmental studies, geography and international law into political philosophy.\\nExamining three transversal themes (people in flux, distribution of land and resource use, and governance of GSRs), DynamiTE aims to be the first truly interdisciplinary NTT and to open a new field of research on normative questions surrounding territory in a changing world.',\n",
       " 'How to study the turbulent transitions and risky mobilities of global capitalism today? An illuminating, but often overlooked site that lends itself to explorations into the changing nature of our economic system can be found at the interface between sea and city, i.e. at the port. Container ports have often been pushed to the edges of the urban spaces that they used to be centrally located in. A study on the city/sea-nexus will illuminate the dynamics behind the ways in which the center of global capitalism is currently on the move east-wards. This is not a uni-linear shift from “the West” to “the Rest”, but rather, is brought into existence by the nature of the ever-changing interplay between local territorialization and global connectedness. By investigating the relationship between port and city, PORTS will achieve three objectives: 1. to uncover the daily practices that port-related infrastructures enable in order to ensure the flow of commodities travelling through them; 2. to document the ways in which workers employed in the orbit of the port are affected by, and relate to, race-to-the-bottom-dynamics within the maritime world; and 3. to analyze the gradual move of the port away from the city center, and the urban waterfront changes that come with it, and how these are experienced, discussed, and justified by various stake-holders. PORTS will engage with local histories, unruly presents, and possible futures in four of the most important port-cities in the world: Singapore, Pusan (Korea), Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Piraeus (Greece). Through ethnographic work, it will clarify the changing nature of work, the significance of “place” as a site of accumulation and resistance, and the role of infrastructure for the inner workings of ports. Given the dearth of work addressing logistics-driven capitalism from an urban angle, this is the first study that systematically utilizes the ethnographic tool-kit to explore the economic frontier between city and sea.',\n",
       " 'The intricacies of the human mind and its disorders are one of the remaining modern-day enigmas. Whereas recent advances in brain imaging and genetics are currently changing the clinical neurosciences by identifying novel general mechanisms of complex traits underlying risk and resilience at the group level, our understanding of individual-level causes and mechanisms of mental disorder has remained almost unchanged which is important because clinical management must be performed at the individual level. During the Marie Sklodowska Curie Actions-Standard European-Individual Fellowship (MSCA-SE-IF) I will address this challenge. Initially, I will expand our innovative normative modeling framework to incorporate information on degree of genetic relatedness (Genetic Normative Model). Similar to growth charts in pediatrics, for which a child’s height is compared to the normative height at her/his age, we describe the distance of each individual in reference to the empirical population/healthy norm of a biological process. We compute this distance while also incorporating information on relatedness quantified by bioinformatic tools based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome or familiar relationships. We apply this approach in two discrete ways. First, we map the distance between individuals in reference to this norm based on their degree of genetic relatedness (Genetic Mapping), and second, we place individuals showing symptoms of mental disorders in reference to the estimated norm. In this way we can dissect pathophysiological mechanisms on a case by case basis (Disorder Mapping). This individualized approach has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the heterogeneous mechanisms modulating risk and resilience of mental disorders and requires a joint effort across disciplines. Therefore, while hosted at NORMENT, a center of excellence in Norway, I will spend a secondment at the University of Oxford mentored by world leading experts.',\n",
       " 'The importance of mixed-phase clouds (i.e. clouds in which liquid and ice may co-exist) for weather and climate has become increasingly evident in recent years. We now know that a majority of the precipitation reaching Earth’s surface originates from mixed-phase clouds, and the way cloud phase changes under global warming has emerged as a critically important climate feedback. Atmospheric aerosols may also have affected climate via mixed-phase clouds, but the magnitude and even sign of this effect is currently unknown. Satellite observations have recently revealed that cloud phase is misrepresented in global climate models (GCMs), suggesting systematic GCM biases in precipitation formation and cloud-climate feedbacks. Such biases give us reason to doubt GCM projections of the climate response to CO2 increases, or to changing atmospheric aerosol loadings. This proposal seeks to address the above issues, through a multi-angle and multi-tool approach: (i) By conducting field measurements of cloud phase at mid- and high latitudes, we seek to identify the small-scale structure of mixed-phase clouds. (ii) Large-eddy simulations will then be employed to identify the underlying physics responsible for the observed structures, and the field measurements will provide case studies for regional cloud-resolving modelling in order to test and revise state-of-the-art cloud microphysics parameterizations. (iii) GCMs, with revised microphysics parameterizations, will be confronted with cloud phase constraints available from space. (iv) Finally, the same GCMs will be used to re-evaluate the climate impact of mixed-phase clouds in terms of their contribution to climate forcings and feedbacks. Through this synergistic combination of tools for a multi-scale study of mixed-phase clouds, the proposed research has the potential to bring the field of climate science forward, from improved process-level understanding at small scales, to better climate change predictions on the global scale.',\n",

In 2010, MNEs generated value added for approximately US$16 trillion accounting for more than a quarter of world GDP (UNCTAD, 2012). The progessive expansion of firms from emerging economies into multinational enterprises is unprecedented. Outflows of FDIs from developing economies reached the record level of $426 billion in 2012, corresponding to 31% of global outflows, up from 16% in 2007 (UNCTAD, 2013). \\nHowever, there is no consensus in the academic literature on both the factors able to shape the long-term location decisions of MNEs and, more generally, on the ultimate impact of MNEs on their host economies. This lack of consensus reflects three fundamental gaps in the existing literature. First the omission of some fundamental determinants of MNEs investment decisions in ‘traditional’ national-level analyses. Territorial/spatial factors, MNEs heterogeneity and local institutional conditions have been often overlooked in MNEs location analyses. Second the limited attention to the broader set of impacts of MNEs in their host economies and the role of institutional factors as selective ‘filters’ for these impacts. Third the intimate inter-connection between location motives and impacts has remained unexplored in the grey areas between separate streams of literature. \\nThis research project will investigate the location strategies of MNEs and their territorial impacts addressing these three fundamental gaps in the existing literature, shedding new light on the factors shaping the economic geography of MNEs and their impacts and providing policy-makers at all levels with new tools to promote innovation, employment and economic recovery after the current economic crisis.',\n",

A preliminary step for the analysis, is to confirm empirically that the cap in parental leave benefits does in fact induce variation in the gender split of leave. Following on from this, the main analysis will make use of differences in the gender split in leave that result specifically from the benefit cap in order to answer two questions:\\n\\nQuestion 1. What is the impact of the gender split in parental leave on the within-household gender gap in labour market outcomes (pay, hours, earnings and employment)?\\n\\nQuestion 2.

QuardCard combines, for the first time: (i) a smart card (all data is kept inside the card and only encrypted keys are released); (ii) a biometric fingerprint – highly accurate and impossible to copy; and (iii) dynamic one-time-password (OTP), generated by the user's fingerprint. As such, the card only works with the rightful owner’s fingerprint and will improve drastically the security of online and physical transactions. \\n\\nThe card will be marketable in two generations/versions: • 1st generation QuardCard for the generation of OTPs through user’s fingerprint for e-banking authentication and e-commerce transactions; • 2nd generation QuardCard combining generation of OTPs with capacity for physical transactions (card payments or cash withdrawal), replacing the need for a conventional credit card. Due to the certification compliance of the current prototype, both generations will be ready for mass production upon completion of the QuardCard project. However, financial institutions do not easily replace existing solutions by novel technologies. Ensuring and demonstrating a maximum level of user security is a key differentiating factor to gain access to the market. Given QuardCard´s value proposition, combined with the demonstration and certification activities planned for Phase 2, we will be able to enable subsequent market entry. The consortium gathers two Danish SMEs: CardLab (QuardCard manufacturer) has an established network of clients and QuardLock holds the patent and know-how to use biometrics to generate an OTP. Both companies will benefit from the project through a cross-license agreement where each receive a share of QuardCard revenues and royalties.\\n\\nLater the technologies can be spread out to other user areas where a biometric safe card can be of utmost importance.\",\n",

       " 'Centrioles assemble centrosomes and cilia/flagella, critical structures for cell division, polarity, motility and signalling, which are often deregulated in human disease. Centriole inheritance, in particular the preservation of their copy number and position in the cell is critical in many eukaryotes. I propose to investigate, in an integrative and quantitative way, how centrioles are formed in the right numbers at the right time and place, and how they are maintained to ensure their function and inheritance. We first ask how centrioles guide their own assembly position and centriole copy number. Our recent work highlighted several properties of the system, including positive and negative feedbacks and spatial cues. We explore critical hypotheses through a combination of biochemistry, quantitative live cell microscopy and computational modelling. We then ask how the centrosome and the cell cycle are both coordinated. We recently identified the triggering event in centriole biogenesis and how its regulation is akin to cell cycle control of DNA replication and centromere assembly. We will explore new hypotheses to understand how assembly time is coupled to the cell cycle. Lastly, we ask how centriole maintenance is regulated. By studying centriole disappearance in the female germline we uncovered that centrioles need to be actively maintained by their surrounding matrix. We propose to investigate how that matrix provides stability to the centrioles, whether this is differently regulated in different cell types and the possible consequences of its misregulation for the organism (infertility and ciliopathy-like symptoms). We will take advantage of several experimental systems (in silico, ex-vivo, flies and human cells), tailoring the assay to the question and allowing for comparisons across experimental systems to provide a deeper understanding of the process and its regulation.',\n",

       " 'Ruminants represent a paradigmatic case of obligatory host-microbiome relationships. These animals require complex microbial communities to digest plant fibers.  Which functions are essential and how the assembly of these functions impacts host physiology remain unknown. My goal is to understand the underlying aspects that allow the host and its microbes to coexist and to identify the essential requirements of this microbial community to sustain the life of the host. This proposal aims to address this ambitious and fundamental challenge. These efforts build on a unique research platform involving germ-free ruminant animals, modeling, genomics, metabolomics, as well as animal and microbial physiology, developed over nine years of experience working with animal microbiomes. To do so, I propose to identify the minimum rumen community (RuMinimum) using top-down and bottom-up approaches that will complement each other. Once defined, the RuMinimum will serve as a platform for experimenting and understanding how the ecosystem functions and supports the life of the host, and how to modulate it. We will specifically augment and decrease functional redundancy and richness at different edges of the trophic network and measure their impact on ecosystem function and host physiology.  These endeavors will allow us to learn how to modulate host physiology towards better feed efficiency or lower methane production, which will have an immense environmental and agricultural impact.  The results of this project will be relevant not only to ruminants but also to other gut ecosystems and anaerobic, carbon-degrading communities in general.

       " 'The extraordinary diversity of animal behaviors relies on the precise assembly and fine-tuning of synapses in neuronal circuits that adapt to an ever-changing environment. Hence, mature networks are the final expression of experiences accumulated throughout our life. Importantly, young brains are more amenable to learning that older brains, but the neural mechanisms underlying these differences remain largely unknown. In the cerebral cortex, for example, there are two main classes of neurons, excitatory projection neurons (pyramidal cells) and inhibitory neurons (interneurons). Interneurons have a remarkable capability to sense changes in sensory experience and therefore occupy a unique position to orchestrate circuit remodeling.   The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms through which enhanced sensory experience during development sculpts cortical circuitries to improve behavioral performance in mice. To this end, we will use: (1) a synaptic connectivity mapping strategy (e-GRASP) and an activity-dependent promoter to explore specific cell- and synaptic-specific reorganizations driven by sensory experience; (2) sensory discrimination tasks and two-photon microscopy to explore the emergence of cortical functional properties, cell ensembles and behavioral performance; (3) unbiased screenings in cell populations and specific synapses together with single-cell RNA sequencing to identify genes that regulate cell-type specific modifications; and (4) loss of function approaches (shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9) to analyze the role of the identified candidate genes. Our research will shed light on the mechanisms shaping the assembly and function of cortical circuitries during early sensory experience.',\n",
       " 'The developing neocortex consists of two major neuronal subtypes–pyramidal neurons and interneurons. These two subtypes come together in the cortical plate, forming cortical circuits that can integrate and respond to external and internal stimuli. Despite recent advancement in the research on cortical networks of the developing brain, the mechanism involved in cortical circuit assembly remains relatively unexplored. This project aims to identify the sequence of events and factors involved in cortical circuit assembly in the developing mouse brain. As such, this project can be broadly divided into three main parts namely lamination, synaptogenesis and maturation of the MGE interneurons specifically. Currently, the exact mechanisms that govern MGE interneurons are still unknown except that it may involve cues that are produced by the pyramidal neurons. Therefore, we aim to use existing transcriptome data of the different neuronal layers coupled with the acquisition of the early- and late- born MGE interneurons transcriptome in order to identify the receptor-ligand pair that is involved in the specific lamination of MGE interneuron. We also aim to understand the sequence of events that occur during synaptogenesis and maturation of MGE interneurons. To achieve this, we will be performing live imaging on organotypic brain slices of sparsely labeled MGE interneurons and by selectively killing specific classes of interneurons in order to determine the effect of these cells on the maturation of the parvalbumin-expressing interneuron. Altogether, this proposed project will give a better insights into the factors and mechanisms underlying cortical circuit assembly in the developing brain and will pave the way for a better understanding into the aetiology of certain neurodevelopmental disorders.',\n",

Advanced solid tumors are currently incurable and limited treatment options are available – preclinical data on TILT technology suggests curative potential. There are 8 million people dying from cancer each year and the incidence is growing rapidly. New immunotherapies for cancer are more widely available in America than in Europe partly because clinical research concentration in the U.S. Cancer patients also in Europe are in the increasing need of new treatment options.\\nThe objective of this project is to generate a clinical proof-of-concept for the company’s lead product, TILT-123, given with anti-PD1 therapy in metastatic melanoma and other advanced solid tumors by completing a Phase I clinical trial.  This project will last in total about 2 years and allow the company to confirm safety in human for TILT-123 with anti-PD1 treatment, as well as to generate mechanism of action data. Eventually, this could result in improved treatment responses in currently incurable anti-PD1 refractory patients with melanoma and other solid tumor types.\\nTILT-123 is currently in late preclinical stage with all the key proof-of-concept and safety already demonstrated. Pilot product production is ongoing and the Phase I clinical trial is set to begin 2018. EU support would be critical to launch this project onto clinical path. Actors from at least five different European countries would be involved, underlining project’s EU-wide relevance. From the business perspective, this project would allow the company to mature into a stage from where its further development could be privately funded and supported by a pharmaceutical company. TILT Biotherapeutics will invest into further development of its pipeline projects, create more employment and business locally in Finland and Europe, and to bring an innovative treatment option with curative potential to the reach of European cancer patients.',\n",

Using an existential-phenomenological approach, we theorise and explore student-athletes’ learning experiences in sport, providing knowledge that is radically innovative and helps to validate experiential learning in sport. The study responds to European Union initiatives to safeguard the development of talented youth athletes and validation of informal and non-formal learning. \\n\\nEighteen Finnish student-athletes (10 women) aged 18-19 will participate in hermeneutic interviews focused on clarifying meaning in their learning experiences in sport. Drawing on Structural Existential Analysis, we seek to uncover the essential – yet always situated – structures of athletes’ learning experiences. We also explore gender dimension of learning and sporting experiences. Based on the findings, we will propose a framework for further research and provide recommendations for policy and practice. The findings will be valuable for educational institutions and dual career service providers, as well as sport coaches and student-athletes to support athletes’ future employability and transition into the labour market. \\n\\nThe existential-phenomenological perspective offers a novel methodological approach and our study involves a truly interdisciplinary research team (developmental and cultural psychology, existential philosophy, and phenomenological sociology).

CERN secured COFUND grants in 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. They offer CERN a timely opportunity to enhance the mobility element of this programme without nationality limitations. The 2014 Call comes at the end of the Large Hadron Collider’s first long shutdown which once more makes CERN one of the most exciting places to work for the global physics and technology community.\\nApplicants will propose their own research projects. Selection will be based on the scientific potential of the proposal, and on the demonstrated excellence of the candidate. Working on frontier research and technology projects and profiting from the unique facilities available at CERN, the co-funded Fellows will deepen their knowledge in their own field and acquire international visibility and reputation. They will broaden their skills using the numerous training opportunities and through their exposure to an interdisciplinary and multi-national environment. Inter-sectoral skills will be fostered through CERN’s industrial collaborations and technology transfer projects. \\nAttractive and competitive employment conditions are maintained by guaranteeing three-year appointments rather than the standard two-year terms of CERN Fellows. At least two of these three years will be spent at CERN. We consider this provision to be justified by the size of the Laboratory, the diversity of the research and training opportunities, and by the uniqueness of CERN’s facilities. However, mobility will be enhanced through the opportunity to spend up to one third of the Fellowship in external institutions, including industrial laboratories, on paid leave from CERN under the conditions of the full employment contract.',\n",
       " 'The EU considers SMEs and entrepreneurship as key to ensure economic growth, innovation, job creation and social integration in the European Union. SMEs are the backbone of Europe’s economy since they represent 99% of all businesses in the European Union, employing 93 million people and generating 57 % of value added in the sector. \\nThe general macro-economic environment in the EU-28 in 2016 strengthened SME activity in all industries due to the expansion of all categories of final demand. In previous years, the main driver of SME recovery was exports. The year 2016 marked the third consecutive year of steady increases in EU-28 SME employment and EU-28 SME value added. As a result of the recent upturn, EU-28 SME employment has finally recovered from the 2008/2009 economic and financial crisis and even slightly exceeded the 2008 level in 2016. The level of value added generated by EU-28 SMEs showed even greater recovery, at 11 % higher than in 2008. This has also been the trend of Basque SMEs during the same period. \\nPrograms supporting SME exports benefit directly only a sub-set of SMEs. However, indirectly, all SMEs benefit to some extent from growth in exports as higher exports raises a) overall income levels, and hence the demand for goods and services sold by domestic demand facing SMEs, and b) the demand for goods and services originating from exporting- oriented enterprises. Some of the main drivers for a high competitiveness score can be linked to the presence of strong skills and innovation capacity and capability, entrepreneurship and easy access to finance. In the Basque Country we are very much aware of this scenario and that is why the Basque Node has designed an implementation plan aiming at contributing to the objectives of COSME. Facilitating access to European and international markets for Basque SMEs and by providing growth-oriented, integrated business and innovation support services that help strengthen the competitiveness and sustainability.',\n",

       " 'Chinese global engagements are deepening across sectors and geographic regions. The objective of BROKEX is to fill specific gaps in knowledge about how China’s extraversion advances. The project takes an original approach by examining brokers who mediate in transnational fields. It opens the “black box” of China’s global integration by moving beyond descriptions of input and output characteristics to elucidate underlying dynamics. The objective will be achieved in two phases. First, the PI and two postdoctoral researchers will carry out ethnographic case studies in the Pearl River Delta, South China, that yield complementary information on the common challenge of brokering across geographic scales: * Connecting low-cost Chinese manufacturing with African markets; * Integrating Chinese academic research with global scientific communities; * Transnational architecture production. The diverse cases offer insights into the mechanisms of brokerage across distinctive sectors. In the second step, we build on the empirical findings and literature to develop brokerage theory. Social scientific research on brokerage commonly uses the morphology of social networks as its starting point, and focuses on how actors positioned at the intersection between groups operate. BROKEX adopts an innovative approach by examining how actors strategically seek to shape network morphologies in order to bridge gaps between groups. By directing theoretical attention towards relationship formation that precedes acts of brokerage, this line of inquiry advances understandings of how and why brokered connections emerge. Ethnographic case studies combined with critical theorization will generate new knowledge about the processes beneath the “rise of China” ─ one of the most consequential socioeconomic developments of our times.',\n",
       " 'The aim of the project is to explore community differentiation implications arising from the Greek term sarx in Paul’s letters. The choice of primary material is based on the observation that this term recurs in settings where collective identity is established, and where the salvific capacity of collective identity is polemically engaged and negotiated (see Rom 7–9; Gal 5). The earliest group of Christ-believers gathered together in social systems which were in transition toward a higher level of diversity, which is an underinvestigated aspect of these texts. The primary objective is to investigate Paul’s views of differentiation and the constructs of collective identity in the settings where he uses the term sarx, and to consider the options for the translation of the relevant passages. Hence, the approach of the action is interdisciplinary (social-scientific criticism in Biblical studies) and intersectoral (the theory and practices of translation). Bowen’s social systems theory offers the terminology to describe the character, reactions, and development in social systems with regard to their level of differentiation and their capacity to handle psychological stress and to find solutions to new problems. The action comprises theological, linguistic and philological analysis, comparative literature, social-scientific hermeneutics, and the creative investigation of translation options. As described in social systems theory, an openness to individual variation in the social system is central to the development of societal resilience. In this context, religious communities act both as significant resources, as well as potential threats, to cooperation in diversity. The investigation of translation options will make the results of the action accessible to anyone interested in these texts, in their interpretation, and in social systems in transition.',\n",
       " 'How are the outer layers of the Sun heated to temperatures in excess of a million kelvin?  A large number of heating mechanisms have been proposed to explain this so-called coronal heating problem, one of the fundamental questions in contemporary solar physics. It is clear that the required energy is transported from the solar interior through the chromosphere into the outer layers but it remains open by which physical mechanisms and how the provided energy is eventually dissipated. The key to solving the chromospheric/coronal heating problem lies in accurate observations at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution, facilitating the identification of the mechanisms responsible for the transport and dissipation of energy. This has so far been impeded by the small number of accessible diagnostics and the challenges with their interpretation. The interferometric Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) now offers impressive capabilities. Due to the properties of the solar radiation at millimeter wavelengths, ALMA serves as a linear thermometer, mapping narrow layers at different heights. It can measure the thermal structure and dynamics of the solar chromosphere and thus sources and sinks of atmospheric heating. Radio recombination and molecular lines (e.g., CO) potentially provide complementary kinetic and thermal diagnostics, while the polarisation of the continuum intensity and the Zeeman effect can be exploited for valuable chromospheric magnetic field measurements. \\nI will develop the necessary diagnostic tools and use them for solar observations with ALMA. The preparation, optimisation and interpretation of these observations will be supported by state-of-the-art numerical simulations. A key objective is the identification of the dominant physical processes and their contributions to the transport and dissipation of energy. The results will be a major step towards solving the coronal heating problem with general implications for stellar activity.',\n",

First, I aim to clarify the features of European Petrarchism by focussing on its translational origins in two of the most influential European languages and cultures of the time (besides Italian). My second goal is to establish, from a comparative perspective, the place of Petrarch’s Canzoniere in the ‘culture of translation’ of early modern British Isles and France, in other words, all the modes and conceptions of translation in these linguistic spaces. My third objective is to identify the impact of early modern ‘translational imaginaries’ of Petrarch’s Canzoniere (that is to say, conceptions and representations of Petrarchan poetry in translated texts) in subsequent centuries, thus tracing their ramifications in these two interlinked literary cultures. The University of Montreal (UdeM) is the ideal environment to achieve this ambitious outcome and to improve my skills in translations studies during the first two years of the Fellowship.

ELDAR offers a comprehensive perspective, highlighting the interconnections between these three aspects – for example, the particular policies chosen may mitigate or exacerbate specific risks to the regime – and studying them jointly in one framework. ELDAR will address the preferences and capacities of vital actors in autocratic politics – the leader, regime support groups, and mobilized opposition groups. Special attention will be directed towards identifying and linking the different actors entering support and opposition coalitions to constituent social groups (e.g., industrial workers and landowners). Team members will also study the specific, and diverse, institutions that underpin autocracies, such as characteristics of regime parties or legislative elections. In extension, ELDAR will explicitly model – theoretically and empirically – how support- and opposition groups and institutions interact in affecting regime change and policy making in autocracies. \\n\\nExamples of more specific questions include: Are autocracies less willing to use the education system for ideological indoctrination if the regime tightly controls the media environment? Are autocracies less likely to break down if they provide generous special pensions to military officers? To investigate such questions empirically, ELDAR will collect data, with global coverage and long time-series, on the numbers, social identity and other features of groups that support and oppose regimes. These efforts yield unprecedented opportunities for large-n studies of autocratic emergence and demise. Three other datasets, on education systems, buildings, and pensions, will also enable pioneering empirical studies on core policy areas in autocracies.',\n",
       " 'An integrated hypothesis for cognitive and positive symptoms in schizophrenia:\\n\\nSchizophrenia is a complex developmental brain disorder with three main clusters of symptoms: (i) positive (psychosis, delusions and hallucinations), (ii) negative (reduced motivation and social withdrawal), and (iii) cognitive (memory and executive function deficits). For the last 50 years, the only effective treatment has consisted of antipsychotics targeting dopamine receptors. Yet, antipsychotics control mostly the positive symptoms and are largely ineffective at treating other deficits. \\n\\nIt is frequently assumed that distinct pathophysiological mechanisms underlie different symptoms. Psychosis is associated with striatal hyperdopaminergia, probably due to abnormal activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Yet cognitive deficits seem to arise from cortical excitation/inhibition unbalance. I propose to test, in a mice model, the hypothesis that striatal hyperdopaminergia results from dysfunctional cortical inhibition. If verified, this would suggest that normalizing cortical activity in schizophrenia might both restore cognitive function and prevent psychosis.',\n",

In south and central Vietnam, cetaceans are worshipped as life-saving deities. In some Japanese coastal areas, the spirits of whales are venerated during ritual ceremonies. In China, Cambodia and the Ryukyu Islands, aquatic mammals have all been associated with water deities. These animals continue to carry significant symbolic capital today – if no longer as gods, at least as local “heritage” and symbols of nature conservation, acquiring new meanings in the context of secularisation, (forced) displacement, and environmental degradation.\\n\\nWhales of Power is concerned with the comparative study of human-cetacean relations in maritime East Asia, as expressed in popular worship practices and beliefs. We will examine several of these traditions in different parts of the region, through a combination of historical and ethnographic research. Our main hypothesis is that changes in local worship traditions reflect changes in human-nature relations, which are caused by wider social, economic and environmental developments. Thus, marine mammals and associated worship practices serve as a prism, through which we approach human responses to socio-economic and environmental change in Asian coastal communities.\\n\\nThe innovative character of Whales of Power lies in the ways in which it combines state-of-the-art theoretical approaches from different disciplinary backgrounds in order to reach new understandings of the ways in which human-nature-god relations reflect social and environmental changes.

The spread of Latin is a pivotal point in the development of all European literate societies. Scandinavia represents a unique case study where Latin and the Roman script encountered and mixed itself with an 800 year old native tradition based on the local vernacular and the runic script. From being monolingual and monoscriptal, Scandinavia became multilingual and multiscriptal.\\n\\nThrough an interdisciplinary framework to be developed in synergy with leading scholars at the University of Oslo, epigraphic methods completed by multimodal and sociolinguistic analyses within a linguistic landscape perspective will serve to determine: 1) the medieval writers’ multilingual and multiscriptal proficiency; 2) the status relationship between the Latin and runic written tradition; and 3) the ideological presuppositions and purposes of the use of different languages and scripts.\\n\\nFor the first time, these phenomena will be studied systematically and through an unexplored combination of historical material and modern sociolinguistic methods. This will not only yield new insights in the multilingual literacy of medieval Scandinavia and on its underlying cultural and ideological aspects, but also in its significance in a European context.

The sacred writings authored by women writers provides extraordinary grounds for challenging the misapprehension that the Counter-Reformation was an era of overarching repression and censorship. WomenWritingSaints will argue against this premise through an inquiry into the hagiographical production of lay and religious women that will disclose unexpected proto-feminist and political patterns in their writings. By exploring a diverse range of understudied material, including prose writing, hagiographical texts, letters and autobiographical confessional accounts, the fellow, Dr. Stella will revise our understanding of the Counter-Reformation and thoroughly recast the accepted picture of post-Tridentine religious production through a close focus on the key role of female agency.\\n\\nThe research, to be based at the Norwegian Institute in Rome, will encompass extensive archival searches in Central Italy (Rome, Florence and Perugia) and will create an open-access database with valuable data on the circulation and ownership of the materials examined.

       " 'Despite recent advances in cancer immunotherapy, most patients with metastatic cancer are not cured. Major reasons are lack of homogeneously and highly expressed molecules that can be safely targeted and evoke efficient T-cell responses. I propose that the strong T-cell responses leading to rejection of transplanted organs can be exploited to “reject” cancer by specific recognition of tissue-restricted targets. To this end, I recently demonstrated that healthy donor blood provides a rich source of T cells expressing TCRs that specifically and strongly react to peptides from tissue-restricted self-proteins, when presented on mismatched, foreign Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). I propose that patient T cells genetically equipped with such donor TCRs (dTCR T cell therapy) may “reject” cancer-affected organs, including metastases. A high and homogeneous expression of tissue-specific antigens is often maintained on both primary tumor and metastatic cancer cells. Here, I will identify peptides from tissue-restricted proteins as novel candidate TCR targets. Next, I will identify donor T cells that recognize such self-peptides in complex with foreign HLA by use of my patented method, and sequence reactive TCRs. Finally, I will establish a preclinical pipeline to characterize safety and efficacy of TCRs in vitro and in vivo in innovative mouse models. Outsourcing cancer immunity to dTCR T cells may bypass major limitations in current immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibition and T cells gene-modified with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Thus, dTCRs can recognize i) intracellular targets and thus manifold more targets than CARs, ii) tumor-associated self-antigens with high affinity in contrast to patient-derived TCRs, and iii) self-antigens, which are more homogeneously expressed than mutations. dTCR T cell therapy could treat malignancies in organs that are non-essential for survival, such as prostate, or that can be replaced by a transplant, such as bone marrow.',\n",

However, despite several breakthroughs, the genetic revolution has not provided a coherent account of the development of the mind and its disorders, and the missing heritability is large across human traits. One explanation of this impasse is the complexity of the gene-environment interactions. Current knowledge about the determinants of a healthy mind is largely based on studies whose modus operandi is to treat the environment as a static entity, neglecting to consider the crucial fact that environmental inputs and their genetic interactions vary dramatically between life phases. \\n\\nThe objective of BRAINMINT is to provide this missing link by zeroing in on two major life transitions, namely adolescence and pregnancy. These phases are characterized by temporarily increased brain plasticity, offering windows for adaptation and growth, but also host the emergence of common mental disorders. I propose that a multi-level investigation with this dark side of brain plasticity as the axis mundi will add a mechanistic understanding of this link between growth and vulnerability. I will test the main hypothesis that mechanisms that boost neuroplasticity promote adaptation to a dynamic environment, but at the cost of increased risk of psychopathology if exposed to a combination of genetic and environmental triggers. To this end I will utilize cutting-edge longitudinal brain imaging, electrophysiology, rich cognitive and clinical data, immune markers, gene expression and genetics. I will leverage on massive imaging data (n>40,000) and novel tools to increase power and generalizability and improve brain- and gene-based predictions of complex traits. Aiming to help resolving one of the modern day enigmas, BRAINMINT is a pioneering and high risk/high gain effort to find mechanisms of brain plasticity that support and harm the brain.',\n",
       " \"'The research action at the University of Oslo (UiO) takes its starting point from the striking appeal to the reader's visual perception in contemporary multimodal novels. Drawing on state-of-the-art research in interdisciplinary narratology, cognitive linguistics, and visual semiotics, the project analyses the strategies that enable multimodal novels to assign an observer role to the reader and present a narrative agent or the book itself as a 'co-observer' on eye-level. While research on contemporary English-language multimodal novels has laid important analytical groundwork, a more diachronic as well as comparative perspective remains a desideratum.\\nThe first objective of the project is thus to develop a comparative analytical model based on several case studies of German- and English-language multimodal novels and contrastive corpora of historical multimodal print media such as illustrated magazines. The notion of the reader-observer constitutes the model's nucleus since it allows to systematically address the textual strategies that 'materialise' the narration and appeal to the reader's (mental) eye. Building on this model, the second objective is to contribute on a larger scale to the seminal field of cognitive narratology and further its consideration of media and genre-historical contexts.\\nTo achieve these goals, the project draws on the innovative and interdisciplinary research environment at UiO's Faculty of Humanities and brings together experts from narratology, cognitive science, media studies and book history. The project's activities will includes a research workshop on 'Reader Response, Joint Attention, and Multimodality', an international conference on 'Readers as (Co-)Observers in Multimodal Print Media' and several public Round Table events at Oslo's House of Literature.'\",\n",
       " 'Children are born communicators. A growing body of developmental evidence suggests that the cognitive abilities enabling the expression and comprehension of communicative intentions – so-called pragmatic abilities – which underlie language use and understanding, develop early. However, a puzzling feature of pragmatic development is young children’s difficulties with non-literal uses of language (e.g., “I love you so much I could eat you up!”). How can children be early experts at a range of pragmatically complex tasks requiring attention to speakers’ intentions, but act like ‘literal listeners’ in other contexts?  The objective of DEVCOM is to provide an account of the stages and factors involved in children’s developing competence with non-literal uses of language. The project will investigate the novel hypothesis that children’s growing sensitivity to sense conventions, which determine the publicly accepted meaning of words in their language, impedes children’s pragmatic reasoning with non-literal uses in the pre-school years. The empirical data will be gleaned from experimental studies with typically developing children aged 2-7 years, focusing on lexical innovation, lexical modulation, and figurative language, each highlighting the interaction of pragmatic reasoning with sensitivity to sense conventions in a distinct way. Further, the project will investigate whether the persistent difficulties with non-literal uses faced by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder may be linked to the same source. The project will use a set of novel methodologies combining explicit and implicit measures, assuming that while children’s performance on explicit measures is liable to be affected by a growing sensitivity to sense conventions, implicit measures may be more revealing of their actual pragmatic abilities. The empirical results will provide input to a novel theoretical account of pragmatic development that resolves the developmental puzzle of non-literal uses of language.',\n",
       " 'BENEDICAMUS pursues a transformative focus on creative practices surrounding a particular moment in the Western Christian liturgy: the exclamation Benedicamus Domino (“Let us Bless the Lord”), which sounded in song several times a day from c.1000 to 1500. This moment was granted special musical licence c.1000: singers of plainchant melodies could choose to reprise a favourite tune from the Church music for the day, re-texting it with the words Benedicamus Domino. In consequence, Benedicamus Domino enjoyed unprecedented longevity and significance as a focus of compositional interest, prompting some of the earliest experiments in multi-voiced polyphonic composition c.1100, as well as a lasting tradition of popular, devotional carols in the 1300s and 1400s.  Histories of music have principally told the stories of particular composers, genres, institutions, or geographical centres. BENEDICAMUS undertakes the first longue durée study of musical and poetic responses to an exceptional liturgical moment, using this innovative perspective to work productively across established historiographical and disciplinary boundaries. Encompassing half a millennium of musical and ritual activity, hundreds of musical compositions, poetic texts, and manuscript sources, it offers pan-European perspectives on a chronologically and geographically diverse range of musical and poetic genres never before considered in conjunction. It develops new methods of music analysis to uncover traces of ad hoc or improvisatory performative practices that were not explicitly recorded in writing, forging interdisciplinary contexts for thinking about artistic creativity and experimentation in a time-period where these concepts have been little studied. BENEDICAMUS engages with the beginnings of musical and poetic genres and techniques that were crucial in shaping practices still current today, and reflects on music’s enduringly complex relationship with spirituality, ritual, and the sacred.',\n",
       " 'Social interactions are guided by stereotypical knowledge about others: Should I turn to a male or female friend for emotional support?  Should I be concerned about the foreign-looking person walking behind me? In the past few decades the endeavour to reduce cultural stereotypes has proved to be very difficult and often unsuccessful. The current research program promotes a novel proposal regarding the underlying neurobiological basis of stereotype perseverance: the “rewarding stereotype hypothesis”.  In an interdisciplinary integration of models and theories, I suggest that stereotypes and stereotype-consistent information evoke a neural reward response, leading to powerful feedback that reinforces culturally-pervasive stereotypes and their associated behaviors. A battery of experiments encompassing neuroimaging and computational studies utilizing state-of-the-art tools will test the core tenets of the hypothesis. This will be completed by observing the hypothesized mechanism and then by its manipulation. Importantly, the putative sensitivity of stereotypes to rewards suggests that altering the reward scheme for non-stereotypical behaviors can have a strong impact on decisions and behavior. Following initial proof of concept, I suggest several scalable intervention examples to explore the potential implications on educational, institutional and social policies promoting a just society. Effective communication of these efforts holds the potential for a long term improvement of society. Altogether, the current proposal combines the complementary strengths of the researcher and the host to establish the building blocks for a new view of stereotypes, one that suggests that we can render them less pervasive if we consider their underlying reward value.',\n",
       " 'Contemporary scholarship has often envisioned modernity as a kind of immense cultural earthquake, originating somewhere in western or central Europe, and then gradually propagating throughout the continent. This massive upheaval is said to have shaken the very foundations of every culture it frequented, subsequently eliminating the world which once was, to make way for a new age. This project offers a new understanding of modernization, not as a radical break with tradition, but as the careful importation of new ideas by often timid, almost inadvertent innovators. The project focuses on the rich corpus of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages, which developed during the early modern period. Largely neglected by modern scholars, these translations played a pivotal role in fashioning Jewish culture from the sixteenth century into modern times.\\n \\nJewish translators were never merely passive recipients of their non-Jewish sources; they mistranslated both deliberately and accidentally, added and omitted, and harnessed their sources to meet their own unique agendas. Throughout the process of translation then, a new corpus was created, one that was distinctly Jewish in character, but closely corresponded with the surrounding majority culture. \\n\\nJEWTACT offers the first comprehensive study of the entire gamut of these early modern Jewish translations, exposing a hitherto unexplored terrain of surprising intercultural encounters which took place upon the advent of modernity—between East and West, tradition and innovation, Christians and Jews. The project posits translation as the primary and most ubiquitous mechanism of Christian-Jewish cultural transfer in early modern Europe. In so doing, I wish to revolutionize our understanding of the so-called early modern “Jewish book,” revealing its intensely porous, collaborative and innovative nature, and to offer a new paradigm of Jewish modernization and cultural exchange.',\n",

To address a gap in knowledge about socialist urban planning implementation (especially the construction of mikrorayon) in the Baltic States, I propose to interview planners and architects who were active practitioners during the Soviet era (as well as those practicing more recently) to analyse past, present, and future lives of housing estates in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

       " 'Bridges are key assets of transport networks, a pylon for the society and its economic growth. Hydraulic actions, especially scour are the leading causes of their failure worldwide. Exacerbated by climate change, bridge failures induce fatalities and traffic disruptions with severe economic and societal consequences. To date, the lack of fragility functions and recovery models has prevented the development of a reliable framework for risk and resilience assessment of bridges exposed to hydraulic hazards. As a result, network operators are unable to prioritise restoration and allocate resources objectively and systematically. The ultimate goal of ReBounce is to fill this important capability gap by delivering an integrated framework for the quantification of risk and resilience of flood-critical bridges and the associated transport networks upon which they reside. To this end, the project will deliver for the first time in the international literature: (i) realistic and sufficient flood intensity measures for representative bridge typologies; (ii) rigorous fragility models that will dynamically take into account temporal variations of critical parameters, e.g. scour, debris built-up and ageing; (iii) novel multi-parameter restoration functions that will simulate the effect of restoration tasks on the capacity and functionality of bridges accounting for uncertainties in the idle times and resourcefulness; (iv) test-application of the developed assessment framework on two different road networks in the EU and recommendations for increased system resilience. \\nThe proposed research will be carried out by Dr Marianna Loli, under the supervision of Dr S Mitoulis, University of Surrey.

       " 'Immunotherapy with checkpoints blockers is transforming the treatment of advanced cancers. Colorectal cancer (CRC), a cancer with 1.4 million new cases diagnosed annually worldwide, is refractory to immunotherapy (with the exception of a minority of tumors with microsatellite instability). This is somehow paradoxical as CRC is a cancer for which we have shown that it is under immunological control and that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes represent a strong independent predictor of survival. Thus, there is an urgent need to broaden the clinical benefits of immune checkpoint blockers to CRC by combining agents with synergistic mechanisms of action. An attractive approach to sensitize tumors to immunotherapy is to harness immunogenic effects induced by approved conventional or targeted agents.\\nHere I propose a new paradigm to identify molecular determinants of resistance to immunotherapy and develop personalized in silico and in vitro models for predicting response to combination therapy in CRC. The EPIC concept is based on three pillars: 1) emphasis on antitumor T cell activity; 2) systematic interrogation of tumor-immune cell interactions using data-driven modeling and knowledge-based mechanistic modeling, and 3) generation of key quantitative data to train and validate algorithms using perturbation experiments with patient-derived tumor organoids and cutting-edge technologies for multidimensional profiling. We will investigate three immunomodulatory processes: 1) immunostimulatory effects of chemotherapeutics, 2) rewiring of signaling networks induced by targeted drugs and their interference with immunity, and 3) metabolic reprogramming of T cells to enhance antitumor immunity. \\nThe anticipated outcome of EPIC is a precision immuno-oncology platform that integrates tumor organoids with high-throughput and high-content data for testing drug combinations, and machine learning for making therapeutic recommendations for individual patients.',\n",
       " 'Chronic Neuropathic Pain is frequently associated with peripheral nerve injury or disease. Peripheral injury activates both neuronal and glial components of the peripheral and central cellular circuitry. While it is widely known that the subsequently altered interactions between neurons and glial cells contribute to pain development and to its chronification, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Developing mechanism-based therapies targeting neuron-glial interactions to treat chronic pain will be crucial for improving the quality of life of many patients. Hence the development of novel therapeutic solutions represents a major challenge that demands a multi-disciplinary approach to decipher and understand pathological mechanisms and to translate them into predictive tools for drug development. The NGN-PET consortium addresses this challenge by forming a highly interdisciplinary team that builds upon expertise in areas of academic research on pain\\nmechanisms, industrial knowhow on human stem cell-based tool development, HTS technologies and drug discovery. To achieve its goal we will develop preclinical model systems and assays which recapitulate the human in vivo situation and which can be interrogated for the identification, validation of molecular targets and the development new treatments. A focus of the project will be chemotherapy induced NP and the interplay between nociceptors, microglia and Schwann cells. NGN-PET will carefully characterize rodent in vivo and in vitro models to identify these mechanisms, and will develop rat and human iPSCs based in vitro systems of neuron-glial co-cultures that can be interrogated for targets and used for compound identification and validation. NGN-PET will thus pose the basis for the translation of these model systems into high throughput screening platforms for pharmaceutical research and drug discovery.',\n",
       " 'Cancers arise in cell types that turnover by proliferation and death at highest rates, likely because these rates become unbalanced. Our group found that mechanical forces control both processes in epithelia: stretch activates proliferation whereas crowding activates cell extrusion and death. However, it was unclear what causes crowding and stretching forces in epithelia. I will investigate if cell migration from sites of proliferation drives the conveyor belt forces that control stretch-induced cell division and crowding-induced death. If so, the rate of cell migration could drive the rate of cell turnover and, hence, the propensity for a tissue to become cancerous. While my host lab has already identified roles for the stretch- activated ion channel Piezo1 in controlling proliferation and extrusion, based on preliminary compelling findings, I will determine if it also controls cell migration from sites of division. To do so, I will use established models in cell culture and mouse gut and develop an in vivo zebrafish gut model for homeostatic epithelial cell turnover. Additionally, I will test if frequent Piezo1 mutations in colon cancer impact cell proliferation, migration, and death. If my hypothesis is correct, I will reveal a new, unexpected role for cell migration in not only normal epithelial cell turnover but also in carcinogenesis. Should Piezo1 act as a central transducer of mechano-chemical coupling, it could provide a new target for therapeutics.',\n",
       " 'Myocardial Infarction (MI) is the leading cause of heart failure, which represents a major medical, social and economic burden worldwide. There is a desperate need for new therapies for these conditions. Here we propose a new approach for the in vivo, unbiased and systematic identification of receptors involved in MI, which might become targets for innovative therapeutics. The method we developed, named Reverse Functional Selection (R-FunSel) takes advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and is based on the intracardiac screening of a library of single-guide (sg) RNAs in Cas9 transgenic mice upon gene delivery using the highly cardiotropic adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9). First, we will construct an arrayed library of sgRNAs, individually cloned into AAV9 vectors, driving CRISPR/Cas9 towards each of the receptor genes expressed by cardiomyocytes. Second, we will package pools of this library and transduce the mouse heart, at a multiplicity by which each vector enters a different cell. Then, MI will be applied as a selective stimulus and, after a few weeks, vector inserts will be recovered from the viable tissue and their frequency measured by Next Generation Sequencing. R-FunSel is based on Darwinian selection of cardiomyocyte survival, thus sgRNAs that will be lost are likely to target cardioprotective genes while those that are enriched code for detrimental factors. The choice to develop R-FunSel for the systematic screening of cardiomyocyte receptors will allow identification of novel druggable targets for the development of therapeutics, either in the form of molecules activating the protective receptors or inhibiting them or their ligands. R-FunSel is based on solid technologies that support the feasibility and power of the in vivo screening approach. Compared to biochemical or phenotypic studies, screening in vivo directly for function is a novel strategy to move basic research into translational medicine at a quick pace.',\n",

This project addresses the need in functional morphology and palaeontology for quantitative methods that can characterize the structure and chemistry of prismless enamel, which caps the teeth of all non-mammalian vertebrates. Although structurally simpler than its mammalian counterpart, prismless enamel has evolved to cope with the forces of grasping and cutting through prey, crushing hard shells, and grinding plant material and it has persisted for over 300 million years. In order to assess how this enamel type has evolved to suit these disparate functions, we will integrate advanced structural, chemical, and mechanical analyses of modern and fossil reptile teeth from four dental morphotypes. By characterizing enamel under optical and electron microscopy, X-ray microdiffraction, and X-ray and vibrational spectroscopy, ENEVOLVE provides an innovative framework for describing the structural and chemical variation within prismless enamel associated with different tooth functions, and for teasing apart the key alterations resulting from fossilization. These techniques then provide valuable context for applying guided micro- and nanomechanical testing of prismless enamel, which will reveal how different prismless enamel structures and compositions help maintain teeth under different stresses. The framework and results stemming from ENEVOLVE will guide future form-function studies of mineralized tissues in vertebrates, but may also reveal new candidate structures for biomimetics and enamel restoration.',\n",
       " 'This proposal describes my aim to use a uniquely large multigenerational family to better understand the genetic underpinnings of mood disorders: the Brazilian Bipolar Family (BBF). The family has a high incidence of mood disorders, featuring diminishing age of onset over generations and assortative mating, whereby many of the marriages in the family are between individuals with a psychiatric disorder. Mood disorders are leading contributors to the global burden of disease. Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of elevated mood and periods of depression. Major depressive disorder is characterized by pervasive and persistent low mood, low self-esteem and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. Heritability estimates are 37% for MDD and up to 75% for BP. The current picture for complex disorders is of a genetic architecture consisting of both common and rare variants contributing risk. Genetic studies of mood disorders have not yet individual variants/genes accounting for a large increase in risk. The effect of common variants in the family context is unclear. I propose to utilize the BBF as a unique resource for studying both common and rare variation in mood disorders. Its size offers a powerful means for mapping genetic loci for mood disorders that are individually rare but common within the family. It also provides us with a unique model in which to analyse individual genetic risk profiles, utilizing the large sample size of and predictive ability of previous case-control association studies for each family member into a polygenic risk score. This will also allow me to assess assortative mating, which may act to increase polygenic risk to mood disorders over generations. I will develop an approach which will allow me to incorporate genome-wide case-control study results into family studies – something with broad utility for the field. My study will shed light on the genetic pathology of mood disorders, aiding prevention and treatment.',\n",

Much has been written about political ideas and institutions imported from Europe. And yet no focused, consecutive effort has gone into understanding the ideas that guide most ordinary Indian citizens’ engagement in their political lives. Analyses conducted through Euro-American categories and theoretical frames elevated to the status of universals – rights, identity, public sphere, secularism or indeed ‘politics’ – only generate paradoxes. This project will be a pioneering exploration of India’s demotic political ideas, which it will examine through a close ethnographic and historical scrutiny of the vernacular languages of its political life. Bringing together a team of anthropologists, historians, linguists and scholars of politics, and taking inspiration from the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, it will (1) lay the empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of India’s political life; (2) develop an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages; and (3) explore with scholars of European political ideas the implications of this work for global political theory. Drawing on the PI’s established work on the demotic categories and values in Indian politics, the project will break major new ground in the study of subcontinental politics; extend the methodological insights of the Begriffsgeschichte project beyond Europe; and make analytical advances towards a truly global political theory, grounded not in the analytical lingua franca of Western political theory, but in the realities of political life around the globe.',\n",

By physically untethering from the environment, most energy dissipation pathways are closed, leading to ultra low-dissipation in what we term L-MEMS devices. \\n\\nTo lay the groundwork for technological exploitation, LeviTech outlines a programme of miniaturization of both optical and electrical trapping technologies, to an intermediate state suitable for state-of-the-art sensing, generation of IP, commercial collaboration, and potential prototyping.\\n\\nLeviTech will deliver immediate technological application via beyond state-of-the-art pressure sensing, using a highly inventive technique whereby non-linear L-MEMS yields zero-dissipation sensing.',\n",
       " 'This project will address the emerging healthcare problem of Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a major social and clinical burden, responsible for ~15% of all days lived with disability in EU. Treatment challenges arise from the different biological dysfunctions implicated in different patients and the lack of biomarkers available to guide the choice of anti-depressants. Preliminary evidence suggests that genetic variants may be useful in making treatment choices, but further work to identify relevant variants is needed. Previous pharmacogenetic studies have focused on identifying common genetic variants associated with antidepressant response. The role of rare variants has not been well studied and few studies have investigated the genetics of TRD (patients with two or more failed treatments). \\nThis project will combine exome sequencing and genome-wide genotyping in the unique GSRD sample of 1346 MDD patients characterized for stages of treatment resistance (number of failed treatments). This study aims to identify both rare and common variants associated with stages of resistance, the first such study to be performed. The analysis will focus on genes and pathways instead of single variants, since the cumulative effect of a number of variants is likely to disrupt the functionality of a gene or pathway. The study will assess the impact of clinical variables on genetic finding, and develop a genomic profile for TRD which can be used to guide treatment in patients. These findings will be used to design a prospective clinical trial to test the cost-effectiveness of the TRD genetic markers. I will seek funding sources to implement the trial, an essential step to translate the findings to the clinic. \\nThis personalised medicine study should facilitate the development of new evidence-based treatments and substantially reduce the time to identify the best treatment strategy in MDD.',\n",
       " 'Atomistic computational modelling is increasingly an integral component of almost all areas of chemistry, physics and materials science, especially as its predictive ability improves. However, not all systems are equal when it comes to the predictive capabilities of current methods, and many systems are too large or many-body effects too complex to be routinely tractable. The result is that the promise of ‘materials by design’, deduction of reaction pathways or routine simulation on a par with experimental accuracy has not in general come to fruition. This ambitious proposal aims to address this, with development of a suite of novel approaches to stochastically sample the wavefunction. Recent work by the PI has already made huge strides in this direction, with an emerging approach in quantum chemical space having remarkable success for accurate solutions of small problems. Here, we first propose a number of novel developments to order to extend this approach from a tool for small systems to a widespread disruptive technology, with application to a variety of challenging problems. This involves development of the scope, scaling, accuracy and capabilities of this sampling, including admitting time-dependent, spectral and relativistic extensions. Next, we aim to take the successful philosophy of this sampling and exploit its powerful approach in order to reformulate a number of well-established electronic structure tools. Allowing stochasticity has the potential to yield low-scaling formulations of these methods, able to naturally exploit inherent sparsity, and have a revolutionary impact on their use and success. This proposal is highly interdisciplinary, spanning a range of applications and techniques in quantum chemistry, condensed matter and materials science, brought together under the banner of exploiting inherent sparsity by establishing a new paradigm of stochastic tools for correlated electrons, with the opportunity for tremendous impact in a number of fields.',\n",
       " 'Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are common co-morbidities (AF-HF). AF-HF is prevalent in Europe with high rates of hospitalisation and death. AF-HF patients have two treatment options: rate control, where AF is not treated but drugs are used to slow the heart rate, or rhythm control, where AF is treated to restore sinus rhythm. Rate control is the first-line treatment, yet specific patient groups do much better under rhythm control. Identifying patients that will do best under rhythm control remains a significant clinical challenge. \\n\\nPotential responders to rhythm control can be identified by their disease history, however, this is often unknown, or their response to treatment, which can only be observed once the therapy has been delivered. We propose to address these challenges by developing patient specific biophysical cardiac models to infer patient history and predict patient response to treatment to inform optimal therapy selection for individual patients.\\n\\nA model for simulating AF-HF in human hearts, representing all four cardiac chambers, will be created. Bayesian uncertainty quantification techniques will be used to combine physical laws, physiology, population data and measurements from individual patients into cardiac models that account for data uncertainty in model parameters and simulation predictions. \\n\\nPatient specific cardiac models will be used to answer three critical clinical questions in prospective studies. Models will be used to predict: if AF led to HF, or HF led to AF in AF-HF patients where the index disease is unknown, response to rhythm control therapy in AF-HF patients and in which AF-HF patient’s rate or rhythm control is best.\\nThis proposal outlines an ambitious high risk/return program to address key technical challenges in bringing predictive patient specific models into clinical studies and will apply these innovative techniques to address important clinical questions on the treatment of patients suffering AF-HF.',\n",

To this end, I propose to conduct a novel ethnographic study of digital humanists at work, combined with a critical analysis of local infrastructure. The research has three main objectives: 1) the epistemological goal is to develop a new theoretical framework for examining a laboratory in Digital Humanities (DH) drawing on Science and Technology Studies and Knowledge Infrastructures; 2) the methodological task aims at integrating laboratory ethnography and the ethnography of infrastructure to build a new toolset for studying the intertwining of human organisation and infrastructure; and 3) the central work package focuses on investigating DH knowledge creation based on two case studies: King’s Digital Lab and the Cambridge Digital Humanities Lab. The case studies will provide comprehensive and comparative knowledge of DH organisational systems and practices. The study will be based on the observation of, and interviews with, participants involved in the labs, the analysis of written documents, and the analysis of digital communications. This project comes at a key moment, one at which, it is necessary to examine the impact of socio-material assemblages on the process of knowledge production in order to improve the research infrastructure.

       " 'A crucial source of neutrons in stars is the nuclear reaction Ne-22(alpha,n)Mg-25, of major importance for the synthesis of heavy elements. Currently there is an established picture of the astrophysical scenario but only limited availability of reliable experimental data, with several key ingredients under dispute. SHADES will perform a direct measurement of the reaction to resolve the main open questions. The goal is to decrease the uncertainty in the astrophysical reaction rate in the relevant temperature range by at least one order of magnitude, providing a significant leap ahead from the state of the art. SHADES will deliver an increase in sensitivity of more than two orders of magnitude over the state of the art. We will gather direct experimental data over the entire astrophysically relevant energy range. We will construct a neutron detector specifically designed for this measurement. Beam-induced background, a severe problem in the past, will be discriminated by measuring the neutron energy while still maintaining a very detection high efficiency. In recent years research on capture-gated techniques and combinations of different detector types to measure neutron energies has increased greatly. The novel detector array will perfectly fit this profile and find a large field of applications also outside of nuclear astrophysics. The main measurements will be done with the new accelerator LUNA MV, allowing long-term high-intensity, high-energy resolution alpha bombardments. An extended, recirculating gas target will guarantee target stability under intense ion beams. The location of the experiment deep underground will drastically reduce the external background, the main limiting factor so far for low-energy measurements. In my team there will be also leading experts in the field to update the current stellar models using the new dataset to provide a greatly improved and much more robust picture of this important branch of stellar nucleosynthesis.',\n",
       " 'Geothermal represents a promising energy source to satisfy the growing energy needs with only minimal environmental impacts. To develop and test new technologies for energy production and storage in geothermal reservoirs, deep understanding of heat transport in fractured media is critically needed. The THERM project focuses on the investigation of heat transport and associated thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) processes occurring during the lifetime of a geothermal reservoir. Fractured reservoirs, such as those found in enhanced geothermal systems, are characterized by a strong hydraulic and transport complexity coming from the fractures’ surface roughness, from their arrangement in networks, and from the interaction of the fractures with the surrounding rocks. As a result, the characteristics of the hydro-thermal flow which occurs when a cold fluid is injected into a hot fractured rock mass are controlled by fracture network discontinuities and properties of fracture surfaces themselves. While progresses have been made in characterizing and modeling subsurface heterogeneity in flow and solute transport processes, the effects of multi-scale subsurface heterogeneities on heat transport remains an open question. I propose new 3D fully coupled physical-based numerical models at different scales associated to state-of-the-art field experiments to develop a quantitative understanding of complex coupled processes occurring along fluid-rock interfaces during fluid circulation in geothermal systems. The main objectives are (i) to characterize the combined effect of fracture-scale and network-scale heterogeneity on flow and heat transport phenomena, and (ii) to design new field experiment to jointly measure the integrated THM behavior of fractures. Thanks to THERM, the ER will receive a unique multidisciplinary scientific training by Rennes 1 University that will reinforce significantly her expertise for future research activities and open new perspectives for career.',\n",

       " 'The Western European Acheulean Project (WEAP) aims to characterize the occupational pattern of western Europe during the Middle Pleistocene (MP) –700 to 300Ka–, through the study of Acheulean technology. Recent research has shown that the Atlantic seaboard is the most likely route for colonisation due to the more oceanic climate compared to eastern Europe and to the richer range of resources in coastal areas. Due to cyclical changes in climate with glaciations and interglacials, northern Europe was frequently depopulated and then recolonized through this period probably from source areas in southern France and Iberia. This route-way should therefore bear witness to the cultural links between north and south. From 1 million to 600,000 years ago there is evidence of brief pioneering events in north-west Europe with a small number of sites and small numbers of stone tool artefacts. After 600,000 year ago more sustained occupation is shown by the increase in sites and the much large stone tool assemblages. They also show technological innovation in the form handaxes and possibly in the use of fire, clothing and shelter, which led to the first sustained occupation of northern latitudes. Although there has been much research and new sites excavated over the last twenty years, there has been little integration between the work in Spain, Britain and France. Based on the applicant’s previous experience, WEAP proposes to create a common method of analysis for the study of six Middle Pleistocene sites from UK and France –in agreement with three Middle Pleistocene technologists–, the use of the experimental technology to complete the archaeological record, and the use of new methodological approaches, such as the 3D scanning technology as the most appropriated statistical analysis, to improve understanding of behavioural patterns in order to build models of human dispersals from south-west to north-west Europe.',\n",

Also, industrial manufacturing in the textile industry is responsible for 20% of all water pollution making it the number one polluter of clean water after agriculture. The dyeing process is the prime contributor to much of the water, time and energy consumption that takes place in the textile industry. On average, 60-80 litres of water are needed to dye 1kg of cotton and 80% of the total energy and 65% of the many environmentally hazardous chemicals produced in textile production are a result of the dyeing process. In addition, dyeing is also by far the most time-consuming process involved. Growing populations and consumer needs are demanding more efficient and faster production than ever. Ecofoot has developed H2COLOR-AUX, a revolutionary compound that prevents hydrolysis in the textile dyeing process. The H2COLOR-AUX combines with the dye and doesn't allow the dye to hydrolyse in water thus considerably reducing the number of washes and consequently reducing the water and energy costs, pollutants and production time for the dyehouses. The H2COLOR-AUX is a patented composition comprising nanoparticles that combine with the reactive dyes which is the base colour and needs to be transferred to the fabric, thus, preventing hydrolysis from taking place. During the phase 2 innovation project, Ecofoot will bring the H2COLOR-AUX closer to commercial launch. Ecofoot will produce 24 tons of the H2COLOR-AUX for validation in-house and validation of the efficacy of the H2COLOR-AUX will take place with three dye houses; two in Portugal and one in Italy.

Behaviour science has provided deep insights into mechanisms of behaviour change in this domain in a large number of small-scale pilots. However, the urgency of the task makes it necessary to role-out such intervention programs lagre-scale and quickly. This requires knowledge on how behaviour science based intervention programs can be provided in real-life situations, on large scale, and resource efficient by real market actors. To address this knowledge gap, the ENCHANT consortium and research approach have been carefully designed to systematically evaluate existing knowledge on energy efficiency interventions, reanalyse existing data in the field, design realistic intervention packages, and implement them on 10 million households in six European countries with a large group of user partners of different types (energy providers, municipalities, NGOs) testing different communication channels. This unprecedented intervention program allows testing a large selection of intervention types addressing a large variety of psychological biases alone or in combination and evaluates their realistic saving potentials. ENCHANT evaluates the performance of intervention campaigns not only with respect to energy and CO2 saved, but also cost effectiveness, and effects on well-being of the participants (with a focus on gender specific effects), as well as effects for target groups in energy poverty. The knowledge created in ENCHANT will be implemented into an algorithm-based webtool which supports decision making of policymakers, energy providers, NGOs and municipalities in designing effective and targeted energy efficiency campaigns. In short, ENCHANT will bridge the gap from knowledge to impact.',\n",

Therefore, the lack of knowledge on the influence of the material quality on the load bearing capacity of the final product hinders the industrial exploitation of AM, preventing this powerful technology from being confidently used in every-day manufacturing processes, in particular in low developed European countries.\\nThe overall objective of the SIRAMM project is to significantly strengthen research in the AM field at the Polytechnical University of Timisoara (UPT, Romania). To achieve this aim, SIRAMM will build upon the existing science and innovation base of UPT, creating a network with two internationally-leading counterparts at EU level: Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Norway) and the University of Parma (Italy).\\nIn the long term, the project aims at laying the foundations for creating a pole of excellence on AM in Eastern Europe.

To keep maintaning the knowledge transfer well beyond the duration of this project, a regular master course on AM technology will be also implemented in the coordinating institution.',\n",
       " 'Understanding citizen acceptance of the Energy Union, responsiveness to socioeconomic incentives for increased ownership, and prosumerism requires a multidisciplinary understanding of social systems and inclusiveness and robustness of policymaking depends on having empirically and theoretically grounded methodological tools to assess and adapt policy strategies. SMARTEES addresses this need by an iterative process: (1) integration of theories and methodologies of social innovation and agent-based socio-economic simulation in a comprehensive, flexible framework; (2) unprecedented data collection and integration in five trans-European case clusters in the domains of consumer-driven regenerative energy production, energy efficiency in buildings, low-carbon regional transport and consumer empowerment; (3) dynamic, multilevel agent-based models of successful innovation transfer; which ultimately lead to (4) a policy sandbox which allows a realistic prospective analysis of existing and future policy and market incentive scenarios. Each case cluster addresses a particular social innovation and consists of two reference cases and 4-5 followers. This enables SMARTEES to study the upscaling and replicability in different contexts. The policy sandbox is developed in a co-constructive process with users on the case level and in policymakers workshops on the European level. By doing this, SMARTEES contributes to robust and adaptive future policymaking, understanding of barriers and sources of resistance, the effects of the Energy Union on vulnerable consumer groups, genders and cultures. Furthermore, SMARTEES substantially drives advancement of social innovation and social simulation research by dynamic modelling of supply chains, companies, social groups, cities and neighbourhoods. In addition to making all modelling code and findings publically available, SMARTEES also ensures long term impact of the project by developing a commercialized version of the policy sandbox tool.',\n",
       " \"'Index structures are foundational to the performance of database systems and large-scale simulations. Even small advances in indexing can therefore have widespread, sweeping impact on both industry competitiveness and scientific productivity. The confluence of several hardware trends is setting the stage for disruptive innovation in database indexing: deescalating costs of memory make it feasible to organise most of the 'hot', frequently accessed data in memory rather than on disk; and increasingly commonplace accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) offer large-scale parallelism with a lower energy footprint. Thus, in-memory indexing that exploits GPUs could be much cheaper, faster, and greener.\\n\\nHowever, effectively incorporating GPUs into computation is a principal research challenge. To idle the powerful multicore system in favour of exclusively using the GPU connected to it, as done currently, is to squander valuable resources. On the other hand, the GPU has a vastly different computational model, so cannot straight-forwardly leverage multicore techniques. The challenges in handling this dichotomy, in fact, will cross-cut many research areas as the heterogeneity in the compute ecosystem becomes ubiquitous in parallel processing.\\n\\nBuilding on preliminary results that suggest common data structures processed by architecture-specific algorithms can support heterogeneity, this action will design indexes for the coupled multicore-GPU database systems that will soon be ubiquitous. The indexes will enable more responsive simulations of complex objects such as neurons and vehicle trajectories and support the recent proliferation of mobile-generated data. Moreover, through the action, the researcher will transfer technical parallel programming skills to the host, while the host will transfer expertise about new data types to the researcher. The project results will contribute to Europe's positioning at the forefront of heterogeneous parallel processing.'\",\n",
       " 'Despite the progress in renewable energies, oil and gas remain the primary source of energy. Recovery from hydrocarbon reservoirs is subjected to three steps: primary, secondary and tertiary. The primary step results from the intrinsic reservoir energy; the second stage usually consists of injection of water or gas to support the pressure; and the third stage is the process of extracting the oil that cannot be recovered during the previous stages, by injecting miscible gas, thermal and chemicals. To assess the performance of implemented methods during the recovery steps, reservoir simulations are usually performed. However, these traditional simulations are known to be time-consuming, and significant number of runs is required to achieve optimal results. This project will use a combination of advanced methods including optimization, statistics and data-driven techniques, to develop a novel strategy for establishing user-friendly smart proxy models which aim at reducing significantly the run-time in reservoir simulation tasks. The project will be performed at four levels: the physical and numerical aspects of the recovery methods, sampling strategies to select runs for the proxy, learning techniques to build the proxy, and their application for optimizing recovery plans. The project has ultimate multidisciplinary aspects, including reservoir engineering, data science and environment (as CO2 storage is included in the project). The project will be carried out by the experienced researcher who worked during his PhD on the application of data-driven techniques for resolving petroleum engineering problems. The experienced researcher will collaborate with supervisors with a strong background in reservoir simulation and optimization. The transfer of knowledge from the project will have a twofold benefit, to the host institution and to the researcher. Expected results have the potential to improve the knowledge about simulation calculability using new robust approaches.',\n",

Both plastic and genetic responses to changes in the mean environment are well understood. However, less is known about the responses to changes in the variability and stochasticity of environmental parameters. Optimal phenotypes are known to depend on levels of environmental variability. This means that if levels of variability are predictable, plastic and/or genetic adaptations can be expected.

Understanding adaptive responses to such changes in the pattern of environmental variability (rather than mean values) represents a major frontier in ecology and evolution and is the main focus of this proposal.',\n",

       " 'Animals interact with and respond to their environment by processing sensory inputs such as visual and auditory cues, touch, taste and smell. How an animal responds to sensory inputs however depends on its internal state (e.g. sleep, wakefulness, stress, fed or starved conditions), such that the same sensory input can produce different behaviours. Neuromodulators play an important role in mediating the internal state of the animal. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are neuropeptides that are conserved across vertebrates and modulate feeding and reproductive behaviours, antagonistically. They are produced by discrete neuronal populations, and are dispersed widely throughout the brain. Studies suggest that both GnRH/NPY modulate the basal olfactory response by altering the synaptic properties of olfactory receptor neurons. However, it is not known how GnRH/NPY influence the processing of chemosensory information in the olfactory bulb (OB) and ultimately odour driven behaviour. Here, I will use an optically transparent and genetically amenable vertebrate model, zebrafish to study brain function and behaviour. First, I will use genetic methods to specifically label, and visualise the activity of the GnRH/NPY neurons in response to natural odours ex vivo. Next, I will manipulate the activity of these neurons using optogenetics and by expressing neurotoxin/cell ablation genes, and study the effect on olfactory processing in the OB. Finally, after manipulating the activity of GnRH/NPY neurons, I will analyse the effect on odour driven behaviour. This will reveal the role of these neuromodulators in olfactory processing and hence on odour driven behaviour in vertebrates. This project unites my expertise in molecular genetics with that of my host in frontier neuroscience to address a fundamental question of sensory processing, relevant for understanding disorders in which behaviour is decoupled from internal state (e.g. obesity/anorexia).',\n",
       " 'The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and the adjacent pre- and parasubiculum are thought to create an internal map of self-position that animals may use for goal-directed navigation.  This map uses a set of functionally specific and largely non-overlapping cell types: grid cells, border cells, speed cells, object-vector cells, and head-direction cells. The presence of multiple distinct functional cell types, matched in specificity only by cell populations in some of the sensory and motor cortices, allows us to examine input-output transformations and computational algorithms in association cortices with unprecedented power and detail. In order to examine these algorithms, however, an obvious and crucial first step is to map the division of function across cells in anatomical space. This requires recording of hundreds of cells at the same time in freely-behaving animals exploring open spatial environments. Unfortunately the absence of appropriate methods for neural recording at the population level has so far prevented a clear understanding of the broader organization of multi-cell-type and multi-layer networks of MEC, at both micro and macro scales.  \\u3000\\u3000 \\n       During my PhD, I invented a technique called “fast high-resolution miniaturized two-photon microscopy (FHIRM-TPM)”, which, through the use of a portable light-weight (2g) two-photon microscope, allows animals to move freely while large scale, single-cell-resolution calcium imaging is performed. In ANAT-MEC, I will refine this optical imaging method to study neural activity during spatial navigation in two-dimensional environments. I shall characterize in detail the anatomical organization of distinct cell types in MEC while mice engage in naturalistic, exploratory behavior in open spaces. Besides shedding light on this specific question, the project will – by developing a new technology - also open doors to unravel fundamental mechanisms of neural code formation in the mammalian space circuit.',\n",
       " 'The Interleukin (IL)-1 family of pro-inflammatory cytokines are among the most potent pyrogens, and their excessive production can cause several auto-inflammatory syndromes. Additionally, overabundance of IL-1 cytokines can trigger, or contribute to a range of inflammatory and metabolic disorders. The expression of the key members of the IL-1 family, such as IL-1β and IL-18, is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. IL-1β and IL-18, are produced as inactive precursors, which require activation of caspase-1 by the inflammasomes for their maturation and release by from cells, occasionally at the cost of caspase-1 mediated-cell death. We have recently discovered that inflammasomes are released into the extracellular space where they remain active after the demise of activated cells, and that extracellular inflammasomes can amplify inflammation by sustaining extracellular production of IL-1β. However, the sources of extracellular pro-IL-1β are not known. Recent advances in platelet proteomics have revealed that these non-nucleated cells are able to produce their own cytokines, including soluble IL-1β and membrane-bound IL-1α, and are able to significantly magnify IL-1 production by immune cells. As platelets outnumber leukocytes by several folds, they could potentially be the major source of extracellular inflammasomes in the body, or be a major producer of IL-1 precursors that are cleaved by extracellular inflammasomes released from dying immune cells. In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanism(s) by which platelets produce IL-1, and the specific contribution of platelet-derived IL-1 to sterile inflammation, or host resistance to bacterial and viral infection. We believe that a deeper understanding of platelet-IL-1 and their interaction with immune cells during sterile inflammation, or infection might help to uncover new targets for immune-therapies.',\n",

Neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs) show increased duration of proliferative phases in humans when compared to other mammals and particularly mice. However, the mechanisms responsible for these evolutionary differences in progenitor properties are poorly understood. In this study, I aim to explore the function of the ASCL1 and MYCN proteins in human NPCs. These two factors are crucial to promote proliferation in different NPC populations of the mouse forebrain, but their function in promoting proliferation of human NPCs, where they are broadly expressed, is not known. I will evaluate the spatio-temporal expression of ASCL1 and MYCN throughout human neocortical development and I will assess their cellular functions during NPC expansion using loss-of-function experiments. Finally, I will determine if ASCL1 and/or MYCN regulation have diverged between mouse and human to allow for the extended proliferative capacity of human NPCs. For this project, I will use human embryonic and fetal brain tissue and pluripotent stem cell-derived 2D neuronal and 3D spheroid cultures as in vitro models that recapitulate many aspects of human brain development. Together, this work will provide insights into the mechanisms regulating the duration of NPC expansion, a crucial parameter that underscores key differences in brain size between species, and will help to better assess the pathological mechanisms at the origin of neurodevelopmental diseases.',\n",
       " 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a very successful intracellular pathogen: in 2014, tuberculosis (TB) caused 1.5 million human deaths (World Health Organisation). To cause disease and disseminate to other hosts, Mtb needs to replicate within human cells. In spite of its enormous relevance for TB pathogenesis, the precise sites of Mtb replication in host cells remain unknown. This surprising gap in knowledge is in part due to the lack of appropriate imaging technologies that have precluded comprehensive understanding of the fundamental biology that underpins Mtb-host cell interactions critical to design rational interventions. Here, we propose to use a series of cutting-edge imaging approaches in human macrophages to: (1) define how the dynamic interactions between Mtb populations and organelles impact Mtb replication; (2) identify critical host and bacterial components that regulate Mtb replication and (3) characterise the host cell death pathways that control Mtb replication. For this, we will benefit from technologies developed in our group to image and quantify Mtb localisation and replication, such as live cell imaging, super resolution (SR) microscopy and correlative live cell 3D- electron microscopy (CLEM). We will refine these approaches to challenge the current limits of cell-based, high content imaging by combining human stem cell-derived macrophages with adhesive micropattern technologies for single cell analysis; this allows us to identify where and when Mtb replicate and how the interplay between host cells and Mtb impacts this process. Together, this proposal can uncover novel cellular pathways defining the intracellular sites that allow or restrict Mtb replication in human macrophages, thereby advancing the fields of both cell and infection biology. The characterization of the site of intracellular replication of Mtb can open avenues for a deeper understanding of human TB pathogenesis and facilitate development of vaccines and antibioo be here soon',\n",
       " 'As global climates warmed ca. 10,000 years ago came a remarkable convergent transformation of human lifestyles that occurred independently in multiple continents and human populations. This transition from hunter-gatherer subsistence to food-production catalysed large-scale population growth, offering the opportunity for increased rates of adaptation, but also rapidly presented a large number of independent human populations with a new evolutionary challenge. This project will use ancient population genomics—the only way to directly reconstruct human genetic evolution—to study whether evolutionary processes during the agricultural transition differed in differed regions. Which genomic adaptations were associated with the agricultural transition? Did adaptation to hunter-gatherer and agricultural lifestyles act on similar genetic architecture in different instances? To which extent did adaptation in domestic dogs—the only species domesticated prior to the agricultural transition—occur in convergence with humans? To answer these questions, the project will generate ancient genomic data from pre-agricultural and early agricultural populations from multiple human- and domestic dog populations from Africa, Central America, and Southeast Asia. This will be achieved with direct sequencing as well as a new human ~850,000 SNP capture panel designed to avoid bias towards Eurasian ancestry. We will also develop new computational methods robust to the challenges posed by ancient genomes to identify adaptive admixture, analyse copy number variation, test continuous population models, and statistically assess convergence in the genomic architecture of adaptation. Leveraging cutting-edge ancient genomics and two model organisms for the genomic basis of phenotypic variation, this project aims to reconstruct the universal evolutionary phenomena underpinning a watershed evolutionary episode that shapes global biodiversity and the human condition to this day.',\n",
       " 'Gamma delta (gd) T cells constitute a small proportion of blood lymphocytes, but are enriched at barrier sites, where they reside in close contact with epithelial cells. Their location at sites of pathogenic insult and cellular transformation, together with their ability to promptly respond to tissue alterations, places them in a central position in immune protection. We have shown that epithelial molecules direct the development of tissue-specific populations of gd T cells. Indeed, we have identified a role for epithelial-expressed butyrophilin-like (Btnl) proteins in driving the development of epidermal and intraepithelial gd T cells. Importantly, the requirement for Btnls is conserved in intestinal gd T cells in humans. In this project, we will focus on uterine gd T cells, which are arguably one of the least understood populations of gd T cells. These cells bear a specific, invariant T cell receptor, and are thought to become precommitted to an IL-17A-secreting programme during early ontogeny. In other tissues, these cells, termed gd17, can rapidly produce the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A following infection, thereby contributing to limiting infection with bacterial and fungal pathogens. In addition, gd17 cells have been shown to play a role in tissue repair, including promotion of fracture repair. However, the inflammatory effects of IL-17A can also lead to exacerbation of tissue damage and to a pro-tumorigenic effect. In this project, we will determine the functional characteristics of uterine gd T cells, and identify novel factors guiding the development and homing of these cells. Understanding the cues driving gd T cell development and activation at specific body niches is not only essential from a basic research standpoint, but may reveal novel drug targets for various clinical conditions, particularly in the face of emerging infections targeting the female reproductive tract and hindering embryonic development.',\n",

       " 'Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) are leucocytes that play a key role in innate immunity as well as the initiation and regulation of T cell responses. cDCpoiesis starts with commitment of a bone marrow (BM) haematopoietic progenitor, known as the classical DC precursor (CDP), to the cDC lineage. CDPs then give rise to pre-cDCs that exit the BM via the blood and seed tissues to give rise to the two major types of fully-differentiated cDCs, the cDC1 and cDC2 subsets. The key parameters of cDCpoiesis are poorly understood. We propose to characterise the niche in which cDCs develop within the BM and to study how pre-cDCs seed tissues and establish local clones of differentiated cDC1 and cDC2. We further wish to ask how the activity of CDPs and pre-cDCs is altered following infection, inflammation or tissue damage. Finally, we want to know to what extent cDCpoiesis is affected by direct sensing of infection or cell damage by cDC precursors. All these objectives will be addressed in a mouse lineage tracing model in which cDC precursors are genetically labelled through the activity of a Cre recombinase driven by the Clec9a locus. These mice will be crossed to fluorescent protein reporter mice, including Confetti mice that allow for clonal analysis, and the appearance of labelled cDCs and cDC clones in tissues will be followed over time in the steady-state or after induction of infection or inflammation. The dependence of cDC precursor activity on specific pathogen and damage sensing pathways will be assessed by loss-of-function experiments. The interactions of cDC precursors with their BM niche will be analysed in steady-state or inflammatory conditions by visualising the cells in situ. Finally, the consequences of demand-driven cDCpoiesis for immunity will be assessed. The results from this project will lead to a greater understanding of the influence of environmental signals on cDCpoiesis and may have applications in the design of better vaccines and immunotherapies.',\n",

Despite of the great advance in FREAs over the past few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of FREA based OSCs is still lower than those of other solar cells so far. It is limited by two major problems: large bandgap of FREAs and large energy loss (Eloss) in devices.\\nIn this project, I aim to address these issues and develop high-efficiency OSCs from three aspects: 1) to develop novel FREAs with low bandgap, matching energy levels and high electron mobility via designing novel large fused ring donor units, 2) To reduce Eloss via adjusting and matching the energy levels of polymer donors and FREAs for high-efficiency OSCs, 3) to formulate key rules of designing FREAs to achieve low Eloss with high short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) via exploring the relationship between Eloss in OSCs and the intrinsic properties of FREAs. The expected outcomes of this project include new FREA materials and high-efficiency OSCs, as well as fundamental knowledge concerning Eloss in OSCs. In addition to the scientific achievements, the fellow will obtain new interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, and achieve professional maturity by training during the project. Successful implementation of this project will also promote the international competitiveness of the host organization in OSCs.

When Europeans arrived, Canarian populations spoke distinct dialects and did not have the seafaring skills needed to navigate between islands. \\nThe colonisation of the Canary Islands is an example of adaptation and sustainability because people were able to create anthropogenic landscapes capable of supporting increasing human populations on diverse and isolated island ecologies with a low density of food resources. Nevertheless, how first colonisers transformed pristine islands into domestic landscapes to make islands more habitable for humans remains unresolved. \\nIsoCAN project will explore the first colonisation of the Canary Islands from the beginning of the Common Era to the 15th century AD, which represent the last expansion of the Mediterranean farming package, This project will (1) establish the chronology of the initial colonisation of the Canary Islands; (2) determine the geographic origins and the genetic variability of the human population, domesticates (animals and plants) and parasitic species (insects); (3) define the process of adaptation and resilience of the first settlers; and (4) investigate human impact on landscape and the management of natural resources.\\nThis set of evidence will enable us to investigate two transcendental questions: how do humans colonise new territories, and what are the cultural and biological adaptations?

The diagnosis of schizophrenia is complex because of the loss of high specific biomarkers. Research papers have suggested that the differential expression of GABAA receptors in the brain is associated with this mental disease. The current evidence on GABAergic abnormalities in schizophrenia is mostly based on postmortem studies and, in this sense, in vivo measurements of GABAA receptor subunits can reveal additional insights. \\nThis project will develop Positron Emission Tomography (PET) probes which could unveil quantitative information about GABAA receptor expression in schizophrenia patients. However, the lack of imaging tracers with high affinity and specificity do not shed a clear light on the diagnosis in a traditional PET setting. In this sense, the immune-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) is a non-invasive technology based in antibody imaging which reveals a specific and sensitive molecular characterization of the cell surface phenotype in vivo. Nevertheless, its success in neuroimage is limited because of intact antibodies cannot penetrate the Brain Blood Barrier (BBB) in healthy conditions. However, GABARPET will tap into a small recombinant bispecific antibody construct targeting the GABAA receptors as well as the transferrin receptor because it is able to readily transmigrate across the BBB in vivo after peripheral injection.\\nThis project wants to develop di-single-chain variable fragment (di-scFv) directed to α1 and α2 subunits of GABAA receptors. Then, they will be labeled with conventional radionuclides produced by cyclotron as 18F and 89Zr.

       " 'The omnipresence of filamentary structures inside nearby molecular clouds observed by the Herschel space observatory challenges our comprehension of the star formation process. We now know that most of the cold dense cores appear to form within those filaments, which suggest a possible link between the characterisation of the filamentary structure of molecular clouds and the core mass function (CMF). Physical processes such as turbulence, gravitational fragmentation and the influence of magnetic field transform the interstellar medium and leave characteristic signatures within the shape of structures. In order to understand the physical processes leading to the formation of filaments and cores in molecular clouds and later to the formation of stars, many statistical tools have been developed to characterise such signatures. Among them there are the probability distribution function (PDF), which form the foundation of many modern theories of star formation, and the power spectrum analysis, which started with the pioneer work of Andrey Kolmogorov and remains our best tool today to analyse and characterise the turbulence. Usually measured independently, I propose in this project to unify both analysis through a multi-scale analysis approach of nearby molecular clouds. In the recent years, I developed wavelet based analysing techniques allowing me to separate the different statistical signatures of physical processes involved in filaments and cores formation. Furthermore, part of these techniques also imply the analysis of linear polarisation allowing a unique multi-scale description of the interstellar magnetic field. The aim of this project is to build a global and coherent picture, based on observations, of how cloud structures and magnetic fields have an impact on the formation of dense cores.',\n",
       " 'Space Data Gateway (SDG) is an Intelligent NanoSat Communication service in Low Earth orbit (LEO), capable of transmitting on-demand space data (speeds of data transmission of 150 Mbps and above) at a fraction of the cost (as low as 5 EUR per GB). The main innovation is the capability for NanoSats to interconnect in LEO by using SDG satellite communication modules and antennas and transmit up-to 50x more data per mission.  The proposed service will enable the user to have plug & play satellite communication system and AI-based autonomous mission operations capability, as well as cloud-based Digital Mission Control. This will reduce the price of NanoSat missions by 65% on average and at the same time lower the complexity of the satellite communications and increase the volume of the space data transmitted. Having on-demand access to a given LEO satellite makes its operations much safer and redundant. The successful implementation of SDG data service will result in acquiring hundreds of terabytes of space data per year from NanoSats. This will have positive impact on educational, science and commercial space missions’ outcome while also guaranteeing stable recurrent cashflow for the service. The initial commercialisation estimates are for up-to 50 new satellite customers per year.  The service will also have strategic value to EU – enabling unique satellite data network solution for all European entities and ensuring that Europe will lead in LEO space missions on commercial and science-level. The solution will open the door for next generation of European innovators to access LEO space data faster and commercialize it directly in non-space industries. SDG service will enable NanoSats with diverse missions to connect and empower the first common satellite network in LEO.',\n",

Safety is one of the most important factors in road maintenance with over 26,000 lives lost on EU roads alone with another 135,000 seriously injured with the total social cost estimated at €100 bn. Adverse weather conditions are the primary source of road accidents, with risk increased by 9 times on snowy roads and 20 times on icy roads.\\nCurrent conventional methods for monitoring and forecasting road conditions have several disadvantages such as; cannot present real-time road surface data for an entire region at road level or are too costly to implement of whole road networks. These disadvantages mean that winter road maintenance is still undertaken using the experience and decision making of the staff without the use of real-time data to aid decision making.\\nTo address this need, KLIMATOR presents its Road Status Information Technology, which uses unique algorithms to interpret 3 key data sources to monitor and predict road surface conditions on an entire road network with a well-designed and clear user interface. Our algorithms then process this data which can be represented on a visual map of the whole road network. RSI allows contractors to decrease 20-30% of winter road maintenance costs while increase the safety and efficiency of the roads by keeping them open and decreasing costs (-5% vehicle wear, -20% fuel usage). The data produced using this system will also be sold to OEM car manufacturers as a friction mapping service, to give drivers and autonomous cars real-time information to increase safety.\\nOur business opportunity relies on an estimated Total Available Market, within the EU alone, of €54M for our RSI system and another €4M for our initial friction mapping service. We estimate the RSI project will allow us to generate a cumulative net income of €27.8M in the period 2020-23 and a ROI of 13.97, achieving the breakeven during 2022.',\n",

Intervention planning is based on patient data and surgeons experience. Even the best plans are often revised in real-time during surgery. Can we understand and predict blood flow changes due to a surgery? Complex interactions must be foreseen between three scales:  the local point of intervention, whole organ perfusion and function, and the entire circulation. Such complexity calls for modelling and simulation, which should become part of the surgical decision process.\\nYet, the modelling community does not sufficiently respond to these challenges. Despite great advances in blood flow simulation, clinical translation remains largely unfulfilled, as existing tools are too heavy, pathological interactions complex and multidisciplinary collaboration uneasy. Organ interactions and remodelling due to surgery or diseases are missing from comprehensive models. Besides, simulations must be based on patient data, ideally non-invasive ones. Despite great advances in dynamic imaging, the link between signal and underlying tissue perfusion and function remains to be elucidated, beyond current pharmacokinetics models. Their better understanding will bring new data for personalised simulation.\\nOur ambition is to gear hemodynamics modelling towards diseased organs to guide associated surgical acts, focusing on lung and liver. We will investigate a novel approach of an injected substance model transported through the cardiovascular system; i.e. enhancing pharmacokinetics modelling by transport phenomena based on hemodynamics. Numerical simulations of such models will unravel the interplay between architecture, perfusion and function in diseased organs, and provide peri- & peroperative guiding information. This project will impact bioengineering, pathophysiology, dynamic imaging, and surgery through the final aim of software clinical translation.',\n",

We will first investigate the effects of short-term PULVAD support on systemic hemodynamics and left ventricular mechanoenergetics in a large animal model of acute heart failure. We will then perform a pivotal randomized controlled study to investigate the safety and efficacy of long-term PULVAD support in promoting sustained cardiac recovery in a large animal model of chronic heart failure. If validated, this new technology has the potential to improve quality of life and ease the socioeconomic burden of advanced heart failure. In addition, histological, cellular and molecular analysis of paired myocardial biopsies obtained pre/post-PULVAD unloading will provide insight into mechanisms underlying cardiac reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery.',\n",

       " 'Materiko is an Italian company specialising in the manufacture of revolutionary artificial high quality textiles. Due to the flexibility, and high-quality afforded by genuine leather, compared to conventional textiles, it has been used for centuries as material in several industries. However, leather is prone to scratching, water damage and UV damage which can limit its uses, particularly in external applications. Furthermore, the way in which leather is produced presents a huge environmental problem. The tanning process for genuine leather uses on average 360 L of water per m2 and over 50 L of that needs to be processing by wastewater treatment plants for chromium waste considered to be hugely toxic by the EU. To alleviate these environmental problems as well as consumer movement towards non-animal origin products a range of artificial leathers have been developed such as PVC and polyurethane (PU) based faux leathers and natural plant based options. PVC and PU based artificial leather have their own environmental problems including similarly high water usage, use of toxic chemicals and poor recyclability. Both plastic based and plant based leather alternatives have durability and quality issues when replicating genuine leather. The need for a high-quality, more durable, weather-proof leather like material which eliminates animal cruelty, water usage and toxic wastage associated with the genuine leather industry is clear and one for which Materiko have developed an innovative solution. Our EcoLeather is a novel material manufactured using an innovative semi-automatic manufacturing technique which produces a water and chemical free leather alternative which improves upon the physical properties of genuine, such as durability, scratch and weather resistance. With the high-end leather goods market worth an estimated €45 bn globally there is a huge demand for a leather alternative with improved physical properties.',\n",
       " \"The PENELOPE project builds on the hypothesis that there was a significant but tacit contribution of textile technology involved in the advent of science in ancient Greece. Bruno Latour recently claimed that technologies require an original mode of existence that accounts for their particular form of detour. I agree and propose the technological labyrinth of threads in weaving as a paradigm for this mode. In contrast to the well-known but insufficient idea of hylemorphism (a form/idea applied to material) I suggest the concept of penemorphism (a co-existence of shifting and un-shifting threads, 'pene' in Greek) that enables to describe the integration of various levels and elements that are included in each and every technology, especially the digital ones. I focus in theory and practice on the technological principles of ancient weaving. In archaic Greece, we find a veridiction, a very particular way of telling the truth in weaving terms that is hidden behind the relations of metaphor and concept or mythos and logos. I detect this veridiction in all sorts of ancient texts, be they philosophical, poetical, mythographic, cosmological, or mathematical. Ancient weaving contains framing features that are lost in modern clothing technology but were decisive for their use as a model of cosmic order. For this investigation I set up a PENELOPEan laboratory where I 1. Detect the models and topologies of weaves (ancient and modern) 2. Develop codes to make them virtually explorable, and 3. Compare different types of coding and their scope with regard to their dependence on specific systems. The laboratory work is accompanied by a comparative investigation of archaic Greek texts, a selective investigation of scientific theories that employ concepts analogous to my weaving paradigm, and an anthropological investigation of the relation of codes, notations and conditions for the development of notation systems.\",\n",

We will focus on the origin of new structures, stains, in the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) recently revealed by the LOFAR radio telescope and model their contamination to the observations of the Epoch of Reionization. The study of the diffuse ISM is key for pivotal astrophysical problems, such as the inefficiency of the star formation process. The ISM fills the Galaxy with cosmic rays, multiphase gas, and dust particles, all coupled with magnetic fields. It is through their interactions that a complex cycle, involving phase transitions, magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, and gravity, is expected to convert diffuse/warm matter into denser/colder regions, where stars form at a rate of only a few solar masses per year. In theory, magnetic fields in the ISM may explain such low star-formation rate. In practice, characterizing magnetism at the starting point of this cycle of matter has been a difficult observational challenge until now. Today, the Planck satellite and LOFAR are unique complementary datasets to investigate phase transition between warm/ionized and atomic magnetized ISM. MUSICA proposes an unprecedented joint analysis of the Planck/LOFAR data with the best-available kinematic data of the atomic and ionized hydrogen to investigate the MHD origin of the stains. By comparing observations with synthetic data from state-of-the-art MHD simulations of the ISM, MUSICA will (1) significantly advance our knowledge of structure formation in the diffuse ISM and (2) prepare foreground analyses for future cosmological probes, such as LOFAR and the SKA radio telescopes.

It will aim to improve exchange synergies between researchers and users, decision-makers and consumers, industry, SMEs and national and international authorities. The project in order to achieve this, will further review the current situation in 50 European cities employing its unique methods of analysis, produce detailed case studies of four specifically chosen municipalities/cities, and demonstrate a self-assessment baseline assessment tool for water and waste in cities, which will enhance the implementation of European Smart City activities, to be published in the Blue City Atlas. It will, in a carefully planned step-by step process, collate data and formulate sufficient recommendations in order to produce  an administrative methodology capable of eliminating cross sector barriers between water, waste and Smart City sectors to be described in a practical guidance document  for the use of all relevant stakeholders. This will be supported by a programme of dissemination ensuring a wider public understanding of the nature of water and waste systems within the structures of European municipalities, regions and countries.\",\n",
       " 'Light is a fascinating reagent for chemistry as it provides energy to drive reactions, but leaves no trace. In visible light photoredox catalysis the initial electron transfer from the excited dye to a substrate yields radical anion or radical intermediates, which dominate the subsequent chemistry. Carbanions, which are the most important nucleophiles in organic chemistry, are typically not available from photocatalysis. The project PHAROS aims to overcome the current limitation of visible light photocatalysis to radical chemistry and extend its use to carbon nucleophiles. To obtain carbanions for organic synthesis using visible light, we propose three specific project tasks:\\n\\n1) We develop the next generation of visible light photocatalysts extending the current energetic limit of bond activation required for carbanion generation. This task is based on our recently developed consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (conPET) strategy accumulating the energy of more than one photon for synthesis. Now, the reduction power is further increased reaching potentials of alkali metals and allowing sequential two-electron transfers as needed for preparing carbanions.\\n\\n2) This technology is then used to generate carbanions from neutral starting materials by visible light photoinduced one- or two-electron transfer. The concept allows a light-driven synthetic carbanion chemistry without the stoichiometric use of reducing reagents, such as magnesium, zinc or lithium.\\n\\n3) Faster and cleaner reactions, longer catalyst lifetimes and selective photocatalytic sequences are achieved by sensitized photocatalysts and pulsed light excitation. This will enhance the overall energy efficiency of photoredox catalysis facilitating practical applications.\\n\\nThe energy of visible light provides the redox energy to generate carbanions for organic synthesis and thereby broadens the synthetic use of the most abundant and sustainable energy source on earth, visible light.',\n",

       " 'Atmospheric new particle formation adds large spatial and temporal variations to the number size distributions of atmospheric aerosol particles, which brings great complexity in evaluating their health and climatic impacts. It is therefore crucial to understand the formation of atmospheric new particles from gas phase and their subsequent growth at a fundamental level. This solution however is obscured by the over-simplified theory in describing the free-molecular mass-mobility-size relationship. The MaSMob-Lion project is proposed to refine the theoretical basis of the mass-mobility-size relationship to improve its accuracy and reliability in describing the initial particle formation from gas phase.  In MaSMob-Lion, the ER will focus on the carrier gas polarizability and conformation effects of <10 nm particles. These effects on mass-mobility relation will be probed experimentally with isomeric monomers and multimers in different carrier gases using the tandem mass-mobility setup and their linkage to particle size will be rationalised through the effective diameter approach with correction terms. Especially, the ER attempts to extend the parameterisations down to the sub-1 nm range for a consistent mass-mobility-size system capable of describing the gas-to-particle phase transition and the subsequent growth. These new knowledges will be used in formulating an easily implementable simple model to assist a quick conversion between mass, mobility and size.  Aerosol particles can be measured by their mass and mobility. But in addition, sub-3 nm particles can also be studied via a growth-based method in a supersaturated condensable vapour. The ER will also conduct alternative and complementary mass-mobility study through supersaturation. While aiming to obtain a holistic picture on the mass-mobility-size relationship that can be used to compare different measurement techniques, these additional data will also be used in model validation and refinement.',\n",
       " 'It often happens that we accept as true what other people tell us, and by doing so, we acquire knowledge about the world. We trust each other, and we often grant teachers and experts authority over our beliefs. The inter-subjective nature of belief formation has recently moved into the very center of epistemology. However, it is rarely mentioned that the reflection on the role of other people in our knowledge-acquisition has a distinguished historical pedigree, one that still deeply affects the way think about these issues. In particular, the Greek philosophers’ treatment of the notions of authority, trust, and disagreement has exerted strong influence on the subsequent history of philosophy. Up to now, however, there has been no systematic study of this important aspect of Greek thought. This project, “Socrates and Plato on Epistemic Authority”, focuses on the role attributed to what philosophers call “epistemic authority” (i.e. authority over belief) in knowledge acquisition and belief formation in the classical era of Ancient Greek philosophy (esp. in Socrates and Plato). Thus, the project aims to improve the understanding of Greek epistemology and to offer a historical background and an independent contribution to a central epistemological topic.',\n",

The case was brought by a civic group based in part on citizen sensed-evidence which involved volunteer observations performed over years. This practice entailing grassroots-driven environmental monitoring could be qualified as ‘Citizen Science’ and, more specifically, ‘Citizen Sensing’. The contamination could not be proved through existing data held by competent authorities since the company never filed any record of pollution with the competent authority. Rather, the monitoring and data collection was almost entirely conducted by local residents. \\nCases such as the Formosa litigation are expected to increase drastically. They pose urgent research questions. Above all, the case motivates an investigation of the potential of introducing Citizen Sensing as a source of evidence in litigation over environmental wrongdoings. Furthermore, Citizen Sensing may also play a role in avoiding the court stage, as a tool to mediate the environmental conflict and to steer the responsible company to adopt an environmentally-compliant behaviour. \\nRelated research is still in its infancy. The few championing actors in the debate are located in the U.S., not flanked by a parallel inquiry from the European perspective. The key objective of the Sensing for Justice project is to fill this knowledge gap in order to avoid a possible scientific and legislative vacuum, and provide newly required research capacity in the EU. The research will be hosted by the European Commission Joint Research Centre, currently leading actor in the research on Citizen Science for environmental monitoring and reporting, which will allow me to play a crucial role in the enactment of measures to release Citizen Science for litigation and mediation’s potential across the EU.',\n",

Aware of this “inconvenient truth”, Europe launched strategies, with precise energy savings and gas emissions reductions, to be reached by 2020 and an ultimate sustainable energy system by 2050. As a large share of energy consumption is spent by the household sector (heating, air conditioning, refrigeration), advanced thermal insulation products give a crucial contribution to better energy efficiency.\\nVacuum Insulation Panels (VIPs) are currently the most effective solution. By offering ten times higher thermal insulation than traditional materials of the same thickness, VIPs use less material, thus saving usable spaces. Besides the high insulation capacity, volume reduction by the use of VIPs eases waste disposal, lowers extra logistic costs and transport emissions while reducing the energy needed to keep the temperature at a desired level. On the other hand, high performance VIPs are still unaffordable for the majority of customers mainly due to the costly fumed silica core (~50% of the VIP cost). The search for cost-effective core materials is a challenge for the scientific community but, revolutionary and cheap nanostructured polystyrene foam (SUMFOAM), recently developed by Sumteq GmbH, may fill this gap in VIP technology. \\nThis project focuses on the unique combination of SUMFOAM with VIP.

European clinical guidelines recommend prescription of 'basal-bolus insulin therapy' as it is the most flexible, adaptable and precise regimen available to mimic the physiological secretion of insulin. However, it requires a patient-centric approach with multiple daily follow-ups. Since both persistent hypoglycemia (due to incorrect medication) and hyperglycemia (due to disease) are hazardous, diabetic care requires day-to-day decisions combining medical judgment and clinical findings. This overwhelming task is even more complicated due to the current inefficient methods that rely on by-hand calculations and paper-based charts. Thus, management becomes a complex task, increasing the workload for the already saturated personnel. Most importantly, it increases the overall risk of medical errors. Indeed, 42% in-hospital days are impacted by treatment errors, wrong blood glucose measurements or lack of adjustments on insulin dosing.

       " 'This project aims to develop a competitive dynamics theory of the informal economy, which is currently lacking in academic research. Specifically, this project will adopt an institutional theory perspective to better understand three fundamental outcomes in the informal economy: market entry (illegal businesses’ decision to be active in a specific niche), price competition (price differentials between legal and illegal products), and product quality (quality of products sold in illegal businesses). The main conceptual proposition suggested in this project is that selling products through illegal means may still be perceived as a legitimate activity. Building on this statement, it will be proposed that the degree in which actors perceive the sale of an illegal product as a more or less legitimate activity will influence (1) entrepreneurs’ decision to illegally enter such market, (2) consumers’ willingness to pay for such illegal product (i.e., price differential versus the legal version of the product) and (3) manufacturers’ motivation to keep quality standards for that illegal product. The empirical setting for this study will be the illegal sale of pharmaceutical drugs. The sale of illegal pharmaceuticals accounts for more than 10% of the medicines market and over €30 billion in annual earnings (World Health Organization, 2003). It represents one of the biggest challenges for societies in that, attending to the WHO’s Department of Essential Medicines and Health Products, anywhere from 100,000 to a million people die every year due to falsified drugs. Accordingly, this study aims to provide two main contributions: (1) an academic contribution by developing a radically new theory of the competitive dynamics in the informal economy, and (2) a practical contribution by providing a better understanding of the determinants of the informal economy that could help policy makers and regulators in their goal of fighting the trading of illegal medicines.',\n",

TherGelFas expects to create the proof of concept of a new medicinal product by combining advanced materials (a biodegradable, antiseptic and biocompatible carrier, made of porous nanostructured hydrogel based on hyaluronic acid) with the ability to load and release non-steroidal antiinflamatory drugs in a controlled manner. It is aimed for the improvement of the current multimodal strategies of peripheral nerve blockade injections used during and post-surgery in acute pain treatment to prevent it from becoming chronic and that unfortunately are unsuccessful many times. \\nThe first achievement will be that of the training of the experienced researcher in new areas of knowledge such as business development from original concept stages to production scale-up, manufacturing and marketing stages. The second achievement will be to scientifically assess whether these hydrogels can improve and replace currently used therapies, to develop a proof-of-concept scalable product. The third achievement will be to learn how to perform correctly the necessary steps needed to launch a product of this kind, such as record and prepare all the documentation needed to present the product to the corresponding regulatory agencies.',\n",

Yet, like any other, OTC medicines present risks and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. To minimize these problems, the decision to self-medicate must take into account all patient's characteristics and relevant medicine information. Despite the risks, self-medication is an increasing practice worldwide and OTC medicines are easily available in stores and for online sale, without counselling from a healthcare provider, in EU and USA. \\nIn this global context, we created MEDimprove, a web platform for patients that supports responsible self-care and self-medication. The software is a clinical decision support system based on a complex algorithm that integrates all relevant patient and medicine variables and suggests the adequate safe treatment for each patient. It provides health information and personalized health counselling in a convenient, user-friendly and confidential environment. By integrating with online medicine stores, MEDimprove also gives the possibility to buy OTC medicines and other health products. For these stores, MEDimprove will increase sales by providing users with a professional and personalized counselling.\\nPatients have free access to MEDimprove. Revenues come from: sales fees from pharmacies/medicine stores and advertising from pharmaceutical companies. We expect revenues of nearly 1.9 million euros in 3 years in a growing market of online OTC and dermocosmetics sales (which represent 15% of all online shopping and annual CAGR of the EU Market above 8%). \\nWe founded serFarma in 2014, providing innovative pharmaceutical services aiming to increase patients’ quality of life by using technology to promote the adequate use of medicines.

       " 'Manipulation of neurons with light-regulated proteins and drugs has opened unprecedented possibilities for phototherapies for neurological diseases. The host laboratory has developed a powerful new optopharmacological tool: a selective photoswitchable modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). This drug can be activated or inactivated with light so that its action can be finely patterned in space and time. We aim at developing a novel application for this optical tool: a brain functional mapping technique. We will test it at two different levels of resolution. First, we will map the therapeutic site of action at whole-brain level. Inhibition of mGluR is a promising therapeutic strategy for autism disorders, including Fragile X, but the brain region responsible for this effect is not known. We will inactivate the drug locally by illuminating specific regions of the brain and will identify which region is the target for the therapeutic effect. Second, we will map the physiological contribution of mGluR to neuronal plasticity at the minimal spatial resolution: the individual synapse. Activation of mGluR induces long-term synaptic depression at the level of neurons, but it is unknown if it is also true at the level of single synapses. We will inactivate the drug in a single synapse using laser light and will test whether this specific synapse undergoes structural depression. This project will prove the utility of optopharmacological tools to map the therapeutic and phyisological mGluR function. This original approach could open countless possibilities for scientific, medical, and commercial applications. The project is an excellent opportunity for the Researcher to further develop his knowledge and to position him in unique multidisciplinary environment that will foster his career progression towards independence. At the same time, the Researcher’s experience acquired at MIT will be extremely valuable for the host institution and the European Research Area.',\n",

One of the pathologies of vision loss is keratoconus, in which the mechanical balance of the cornea depending on intraocular pressure and internal stresses in corneal tissue becomes imbalanced, which can result in a corneal protrusion.\\n\\nCorneal crosslinking (CXL) is a clinical treatment that increases the overall mechanical stiffness of the cornea by inducing chemical bounding between collagen molecules. CXL is the present of halting corneal ectasias, and the future of noninvasive refractive surgery. However, its micro/nano-mechanisms are not completely understood. Moreover, CXL is usually applied uniformly in corneal treatments, which can result in over-stiffening and unexpected postsurgical outcomes.\\n\\nOphthalmology can benefit from in silico modeling to plan and improve such interventions. However, current computational models are mainly macroscopic and cannot simulate complex phenomena involved in CXL. Multiscale computational models could improve clinical strategies by including information at different scales.\\n\\nMIMetiCO’s goal is to combine experiments and modelling at different scales to provide a multiscale characterization of corneal biomechanics before and after CXL. This characterization will rely on both ground-breaking and well-established technologies that include confocal microscopy, biochemical assessment, and mechanical inflation tests to determine morphological (orientation and density of fibrils), biochemical (amount of intermolecular crosslinks), and mechanical features of the cornea.\\n\\nMIMetiCO will use this information to calibrate the first in silico model of the cornea using a multiscale structural approach to build a virtual framework to simulate potential CXL treatments.\\n\\nMIMetiCO is the next step in ophthalmology, which has the potential to bring into being a new generation of clinical assessment.',\n",

Such a database is an integral step to meet these goals as it can be used in the aviation industry to improve existing alloys and create new alloys important in the manufacture of lightweight turbine engine components. The primary goal of this proposal is to experimentally determine critical binary and ternary phase data for several key systems and to incorporate this information into an existing TiAl thermodynamic database. An additional kinetic database will also be updated and provided at the end of the project. By optimising the phase data, this reduces or eliminates the need to conduct costly trial and error experiments, and ultimately speeds the time to market for the turbine engine components. To achieve the goals of this Call for Proposal, a critical analysis of existing state-of-the-art CALPHAD databases, supplied by partner Thermo-Calc Software AB (TCSAB), identified the missing or unreliable data for several important TiAl systems. Data for these systems will be collected through a series of sophisticated experiments on well-characterised high-purity alloys. The experiments will be carried out by the partners Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung GmbH (MPIE), Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht Zentrum für Material- Und Küstenforschung GmbH (HZG) and Montanuniversität Leoben (MUL), who are all recognised for their long-term and well-documented expertise in preparing and characterising TiAl alloys. At key milestones throughout the project, TCSAB, with the assistance of other partners, will critically evaluate the experimental data and conduct thermodynamic assessments of all the systems under investigation. The final analysis will result in two optimised and advanced CALPHAD databases that can immediately be used for alloy design by MTU Aero Engines, which will contribute to the overall Clean Sky 2 targets.',\n",

       " 'Gender equality remains a critical societal challenge. But how does one ‘learn’ gender? Children’s literature presents one early source of cultural norms, values and assumptions about gender. Language use in these texts is a crucial means by which children learn about gendered concepts and behaviours. To understand this formative influence more deeply, the innovative GLARE project will examine the discursive construction of gender in corpora of English children’s literature drawing on a novel cognitive corpus stylistic approach to characterization to conceptualise the notion of gender. GLARE will further take a diachronic perspective to the development of gender representation over time. The ‘cognitive corpus stylistics’ links together corpus linguistics (CL) and Cognitive Poetics (CP). CL methods combine qualitative and quantitative approaches to text analysis while CP offers a theoretical framework to account for the creation of meaning in the mind of the reader. The approach adopted by GLARE stresses that the representation of real and fictional people is related – in terms of the background knowledge that readers bring to texts and in terms of the patterns used in a text. Hence, relationships between the representation of fictional characters and real people are to some extent a reflection of links between patterns in fictional and non-fictional texts. To investigate this relationship, the project draws on complementary data from the Times Digital Archive. Through the description and analysis of linguistic patterns GLARE will provide novel insights into the way in which children’s literature can influence the creation of gendered concepts and behaviours. GLARE will be situated at the University of Birmingham and supervised by Prof. Michaela Mahlberg, a world-leading expert in corpus stylistics.

In so doing, the project will critically engage with the UN Security Council’s Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, first set out in resolution 1325, 2000. By 2015, the Security Council had adopted seven further resolutions, which together provide a political agenda for change in international relations. Notwithstanding the body of research that has been generated over the 17 years, conceptual ambiguity, normative indeterminacy and conceptual knowledge gaps continue to limit the transformative potential of the WPS agenda. In addition, a lack of political commitment has perpetuated its marginalisation from other contemporary agendas and initiatives relating to sustainable peace. This project will address some of these knowledge gaps through engaging feminist methodologies to provide an enriched, and gender-sensitive  reading of the international legal obligations of states, international governmental organisations and other non-state actors, and in so doing produce research of academic excellence. In developing an innovative conceptual framework for interrogating through a gender lens what is implicated by ‘peace’ and ‘security’, the research will disrupt current international legal orthodoxy in its scope and approach. Through four distinct but inter-linked streams of study, this project will develop a new understanding of the WPS agenda within the changed (and changing) geo-political context and so provide additional tools for furthering gender equality and women’s empowerment during and following conflict that will form the building blocks of a gendered international law of peace.',\n",

       " \"We take ourselves to know certain logical claims, for example that no contradictions are true. However, we currently fail to have an adequate account of how we possess logical knowledge. Historical attempts to explain this knowledge, such as appeals to intuition, have been found to be ultimately unsatisfactory, either because they are metaphysically obscure or fail to explain logical disagreements. Yet, it is imperative that we have a complete understanding of logical knowledge. While we use logic to form beliefs in all areas of life, such as when testing scientific theories and engaging in rational debate, we now have many competing logics at our disposal to do so, all of which lead us to reasoning differently in certain situations. So, in order to ensure we reason correctly, it is paramount that we choose the right logic. Yet, in order to make these choices, we require suitable criteria to adjudicate between the logics, which can only be developed with a full understanding of what constitutes logical evidence. Without an account of logical evidence, we lack the resources to make principled and holistic decisions about the correct logic to use. EpiLog solves these problems, by: i) Advancing a theory of logical epistemology, called 'logical abductivism', which proposes that, contrary to historical consensus, we come to know logical truths similarly to how scientists know truths about the world; and, ii) Developing a set of criteria for the logical community to use to successfully adjudicate between competing logics. To support its findings, EpiLog uses a practice-based approach, inferring from logicians’ practice the underlying methods through which we gain logical knowledge. While this approach has been successful in elucidating how we gain empirical knowledge in the sciences, it has yet to be used in the study of logic. Consequently, EpiLog addresses an important gap in the literature, transferring techniques from methodological studies of the sciences to logic.\",\n",
       " 'Households face large idiosyncratic income risks and use their wealth to self insure. In doing so, they make portfolio choices we can summarize grosso modo as choices between liquid (safe and nominal) and illiquid (risky and real) assets. These choices have the potential to create strong aggregate repercussions as investments in real assets create an immediate demand for goods, while liquid nominal savings only when someone else uses the funds to invest or consume. As a result, portfolio choices are key for economic dynamics and important for the propagation of monetary and fiscal policy. Moreover, household portfolio positions and the liquidity of assets itself become an important determinant of aggregate savings and investment. Yet, they are widely disregarded in standard business cycle models today.\\nThe proposed research therefore develops a novel framework that allows us to understand this nexus--a framework that studies business cycles, household portfolios, income risks, and asset liquidity in unison. This new framework allows us to address a wide array of important macroeconomic questions of our time: how wealth inequality and stabilization policies interact, how monetary policy redistributes, how a housing freeze can create a recession as big as the last one, and finally, why crises are particularly severe in times of high household debt.\\nTo develop this framework, empirical and theoretical work has to go hand in hand: First, I document the historical movements in the distribution of household (and firm) portfolios to understand how and whose portfolio positions change over the cycle and in response to shocks. Second, I document the cyclical movements in asset liquidity. Third, I develop a theoretical framework that allows us to understand the implications of changes in asset liquidity in a setup with incomplete markets and nominal rigidities. Finally, I make liquidity fluctuations endogenous and augment the model with a structure of overlapping generations.',\n",

My idea represents the first extensive assessment of insect head mechanics applying latest semi-automatic workflows and engineering approaches to unravel the factors driving insect mouthpart evolution and performance. \\nSpecifically, I will study the mechanical evolution from early biting-chewing to piercing-sucking mouthparts and head types, considering recent as well as fossil species. \\nIn contrast to earlier studies, I aim to quantify mechanical evolution for the whole head which has never been attempted before for insects. This will be done using engineering software to simulate insect feeding, followed by 3D shape analysis and finally evolutionary modelling using algorithms based on likelihood models of evolutionary processes.

To achieve an integrative understanding, my idea will furthermore take into account ecological, evolutionary and life history factors. Understanding the mechanical head evolution has never been tried before in a systematic way at this scale. However, my project idea also delivers results for industry: Since modern engineering methods are used, the results can be readily exported to the industry for the design of lighter robot arms with better lifting capabilities, thus advancing robotic techniques.\",\n",
       " 'Structural models are key tools of economists to evaluate and design policies. These models specify economic environments, estimate mechanisms that determine outcomes, and can be used for counterfactual predictions. One important class of models deals with skill and human capital formation, which is an important driver of economic growth and inequality. These models study the determinants of skill formation and the timing of optimal investments in children. Since structural models require simplifying assumptions, they are also prone to misspecification.\\n\\nThe proposed research shows that existing skill formation models rely on seemingly innocuous normalizations, which can severely impact counterfactual predictions. For example, simply changing the units of measurements of observed variables can yield ineffective investment strategies and misleading policy recommendations. I plan to tackle these problems by providing a new comprehensive identification analysis and by focusing on a novel set of important policy-relevant parameters that yield robust conclusions. These issues and solutions might extend to many other structural models with latent variables. In addition, I will provide a new flexible estimator for the policy-relevant features and analyze various data sets to reevaluate policy recommendations with potentially large impacts on costs and benefits of large public investments in children, economic growth, and inequality.\\n\\nEstimation will rely on other objectives of this proposal, which aim to develop new econometric tools. These tools are important contributions on their own rights and are applicable in a wide range of settings. They allow researchers to obtain more precise nonparametric estimators and more reliable conclusions by using shape restrictions implied by economic theory and data-driven dimension reduction techniques.

For example, our direct observation of high-speed phenomena is limited by the speed of the human visual system.

       " 'Ultrafast lasers, which allow the concentration of light in space and time, have been instrumental in revolutionizing industrial production technologies, medical applications and cutting-edge fundamental research. A common demand for many applications is the combination of maximum pulse peak powers with maximum average powers, in extreme cases involving petawatt (PW) peak powers and megawatt (MW) average powers. Additionally, these parameters must be achieved together with an optimum beam quality and high efficiency. The MIMAS project aims to address these demands and enable new realms of performance for ultrafast lasers. \\nThe basic idea is spatially and temporally separated amplification of ultrashort laser pulses followed by coherent combination. This overcomes all the scaling limitations known in single-emitter systems. Moreover, the spatially separated amplification will be developed to an integrated and highly compact configuration: an ytterbium-doped multicore fiber. In addition, it is proposed that a sequence of pulses be amplified with an encoded phase pattern, causing a coherent pulse stacking at the system output. \\nThe targeted laser pulse parameters are completely beyond the scope of current laser technology and therefore able to revolutionize many applications. The target is to generate a pulse energy of >1J at 10kHz repetition rate, i.e. an average power of >10 kW, with a wall-plug efficiency of >10%. Together with a pulse duration of <200fs, such performance results in a pulse peak power of >5 TW in a scalable architecture. This outstanding performance, which is three orders of magnitude above the capabilities of today’s laser systems, is emitted from only two fibers and features excellent beam quality.\\nI am deeply convinced that such an ultrafast laser source will be the key element in a number of experiments in modern sciences; not only in fundamental physics but also in biology and medicine, it will stimulate seminal discoveries and breakthroughs.',\n",
       " 'We recently reported the first observation of dynamic adaptive colloidal crystals exhibiting characteristics similar to those commonly associated with living organisms: self-replication, self-healing, adaptation, competition, motility. Here, I propose to do the first experiments to clarify precisely how dynamic adaptive behavior arises far from equilibrium and how to control it. The key to both is a fundamental question at the heart of condensed matter, statistical and nonlinear physics: When far from equilibrium, in the presence of fluctuations and faced with multiple steady states with small energy differences, how does a system evolve? Specifically, my objectives are (1) to form crystals with periodic and aperiodic patterns, e.g. 2D Bravais lattices, quasicrystals, using passive identical particles, (2) to quantify their formation energies through the effective temperature of Brownian particles, (3) to identify the conditions for emergence and control of adaptive behavior. Then, I will draw a complete phase map of these dynamic adaptive colloidal crystals using fitness landscapes to characterize each pattern. I will further ask to what extent this control is extendable down to the few-nm scale, where fluctuations are even stronger and if and how these findings change when using nonidentical, in size or shape, but still passive particles. My system comprises quasi-2D-confined pure-polystyrene 500-nm spheres suspended in water. An energy flux to drive the system far from equilibrium and sustain it there is supplied by an ultrafast laser. My method exploits only three physical tenets, nonlinearity, fluctuations and positive/negative feedback mechanisms acting on identical passive particles, yet generates extremely rich emergent dynamics. A full understanding of how such dynamics arise from so few basic ingredients will advance our understanding of complex systems in addition to numerous practical applications to self-assembly, microfluidics, nanoscience and biology.',\n",

       " 'Lasers, and in particular ultrafast lasers, are an enabling technology for many applications, with the particularity that they can emit high-powers and are tabletop at the same time. These characteristics have made intense laser radiation widely available, which has decisively contributed to the advancement of many fields. However, the spectral coverage of lasers is limited and, thus, there are many applications that can only be addressed with other sources such as synchrotrons. Unfortunately, synchrotrons have two strong disadvantages: they are very large facilities with restricted user access and are extremely expensive. This is seriously hampering the widespread use of this radiation and, with it, the progress and development of many fields.   Since a direct (i.e. a laser-based), high-power emission of coherent light with a wavelength coverage comparable to that of a synchrotron is impossible, nonlinear frequency conversion driven by a high-power solid-state laser seems to be the most elegant solution to achieve a high photon flux in important spectral regions such as the mid-infrared, the THz- and the soft-X-ray range. Most remarkably, frequency conversion into these spectral regions would strongly benefit from a longer driving laser wavelength than the standard Titanium:Sapphire or Ytterbium-based near-infrared emission. On top of that, the shift of the emission to longer wavelengths can unleash a hidden performance scaling potential of ultrafast fiber lasers, as nonlinear and thermal limitations scale favorably.  The goals of the project SALT are twofold. First, it targets a revolution in the performance level of ultrafast lasers by unlocking the potential of Thulium-doped fiber lasers. Second, it aims at demonstrating new realms of flux in selected wavelength regions by frequency-converting these high-power 2µm sources. This will pave the way for frontier applications allowing for seminal discoveries and breakthroughs.',\n",

However, ultrashort fiber laser must operate in a nonlinear propagation regime with a complex balance among gain, spectral filtering, dispersion and nonlinear broadening. Furthermore, all current families of ultrafast lasers are based on single mode fibers (SMFs) and these have now reached limits in their application domains because of their inherent limited peak power handling capability.\\n\\nIn order to overcome the aforementioned barrier for ultrafast fiber lasers, and enhance their operational range, I suggest to replace single mode fibers by multimode fibers. The main goal of this proposed MSCA Individual Fellowship is therefore to develop new ideas for the mode locking of lasers based on multimode gain fiber by controlling their spatio-temporal complex dynamics, and then to demonstrate generation of ultrashort light pulses with high average power and high peak power.  \\nThe nonlinear coupling among the fiber modes can self-maintain a high degree of spatial coherence while permitting a high degree of temporal coherence with the locking of the modes on a common group delay. I propose to explore multimode space-time soliton propagation and beam nonlinear “self-cleaning” in amplifying rare-earth-doped multimode fiber and in multimode fiber laser.

       " 'Every movement we make requires us to coordinate our actions precisely in space and time. This proposal aims to understand how that remarkable coordination is achieved by neural circuits controlling movement. The cerebellum plays a critical role in keeping movements calibrated and coordinated, and it is thought to do this in part through a motor learning process in which predictable perturbations of movement are gradually compensated. Cerebellum-dependent forms of motor learning have been identified for a variety of behaviors, including locomotion, and locomotor learning is used as a rehabilitative therapy in human patients. We recently established locomotor learning in mice, using a custom-built, transparent split-belt treadmill that controls the speeds of the two sides of the body independently and allows for high-resolution behavioral readouts. Here, we will combine quantitative analysis of locomotor behavior with genetic circuit dissection to answer two fundamental questions: How are cerebellar outputs read out by downstream circuits, to calibrate spatial and temporal components of movement? and How are instructive signals for spatial and temporal learning encoded by cerebellar inputs? Specifically, we will: 1) Use circuit tracing combined with manipulation of specific cerebellar outputs to identify downstream pathways for spatial and temporal locomotor learning, 2) Investigate the role of error signals for cerebellar learning via optogenetic perturbation of climbing fiber inputs to the cerebellum, and 3) Image complex spike activity from populations of Purkinje cells during locomotion and learning, to ask how spatial and temporal error signals are encoded within the cerebellum. These studies will allow us to bridge levels of analysis to understand how cerebellar learning mechanisms convert behaviorally-relevant sensorimotor error signals into calibration signals that ensure accurate and coordinated movements in space and time for a wide range of behaviors.',\n",

The overarching project aim is to determine the extent to which lineage and phenotype diversification is impacted by dispersal to new regions (potentially providing ecological opportunity) and by evolutionary transitions between ecotypes. The overarching aim will be tackled via four main research objectives: molecular phylogenetics to determine the interrelationships among >70% of all natricine species; historical biogeography to identify ancestral areas and the location and timing of major dispersal events; phenotypic disparity and diversity analyses to quantify the main axes of natricine variation in time and space; quantitative analyses to test whether different ecotypes and geographical groups have undergone different rates of lineage and phenotype diversification.

       " 'The brain evolves, develops, and operates in the context of animal movements. As a consequence, fundamental brain functions such as spatial perception and motor control critically depend on the precise knowledge of the ongoing body motion. An accurate internal estimate of self-movement is thought to emerge from sensorimotor integration; nonetheless, which circuits perform this internal estimation, and exactly how motor-sensory coordination is implemented within these circuits are basic questions that remain to be poorly understood. There is growing evidence suggesting that, during locomotion, motor-related and visual signals interact at early stages of visual processing. In mammals, however, it is not clear what the function of this interaction is. Recently, we have shown that a population of Drosophila optic-flow processing neurons —neurons that are sensitive to self-generated visual flow, receives convergent visual and walking-related signals to form a faithful representation of the fly’s walking movements. Leveraging from these results, and combining quantitative analysis of behavior with physiology, optogenetics, and modelling, we propose to investigate circuit mechanisms of self-movement estimation during walking. We will:1) use cell specific manipulations to identify what cells are necessary to generate the motor-related activity in the population of visual neurons, 2) record from the identified neurons and correlate their activity with specific locomotor parameters, and 3) perturb the activity of different cell-types within the identified circuits to test their role in the dynamics of the visual neurons, and on the fly’s walking behavior. These experiments will establish unprecedented causal relationships among neural activity, the formation of an internal representation, and locomotor control. The identified sensorimotor principles will establish a framework that can be tested in other scenarios or animal systems with implications both in health and disease.',\n",

However, ultrasound attenuation increases with frequency, limiting the depth-to-resolution ratio to about 100.

It achieves isotropic nanometer resolution in three dimensions with a single objective lens and has unrivaled spatio temporal resolution. \\nHowever, a platform that enables these capabilities in a high-throughput manner for entire cells and tissue has not yet been developed. I aim to fill this technological gap; with my background and experience, I am in a unique position to assure the success of this project and establish these technologies in the scientific community. The performance of fluorescence imaging and tracking will progress orders of magnitude in the years to come, signaling yet another revolution for optical nanoscopy.',\n",
       " 'Investigating the complex structure and functioning of biological systems through light microscopy represents a foundational pillar of the life sciences. However, the very complexity of the samples cellular structure leads to one of the main limitations of optical microscopy: light scattering confines it to the outer most tissue layers. In the past decades, multiphoton microscopy successfully extended the accessible depth ranges and on a different front, advances in optical wavefront shaping showed that scattering can be compensated for, even in regimes where light fully lost its initial directionality. The aim of this action is to establish scattering correction through wavefront shaping in higher-order multiphoton microscopy, namely three-photon fluorescence imaging, to surpass the scattering barrier and reach unprecedented depths in optical microscopy.',\n",

Sustainable biogas technologies have been extremely slow in catching up with community energy developments, failing to benefit from their undeniable potential. ISABEL aims to remove the obstacles and to promote community biogas in the EU by bringing out its societal relevance and by joining forces with a major revolutionary movement – Social Innovation. To achieve and sustain this transition, ISABEL employs modern marketing research to understand the needs and cultural diversities of the communities, fuses Social Innovation to reposition Biogas from an economic bio-fuel carrier to a social good, to come up with new community concepts and to build a stronger and wider community engagement in support of biogas. We zoom in on specific areas with diverse interest and we support communities on the ground to realize community biogas plans in coordination with all the stakeholders, slashing transaction overheads. We bring communities together to exchange and inspire each other as we carefully steer them towards quality sustainability and impact assessment principles. We zoom out to inform the policy world about what works and what does not, what should change and how we can scale-up, replicate and innovate in order to make investments more attractive. We envision a more innovative, better connected, less sensitive to policy and more transparent community biogas movement which will serve as a spring of ideas for other renewable energy technologies. \\nBut we start simple – we want more ideas, more and deeper public involvement, more responsible community biogas plans and more bold and fair policies; and we bring along a highly complementary team of practical minded people to do it.',\n",
       " 'Woodoo transforms natural wood into an augmented material that is strong, light, durable and stunningly translucent. It uses a patented scalable technology to replace wood’s lignin with a bio-polymer that boosts its performance. The result is a material as strong as concrete and luminous as amber. It will be used to create unique auto interiors, lightweight car chassis and sustainable wooden buildings. It will benefit Europe by revitalising the forestry sector. Problem: Global shortage of construction materials (concrete, steel), even as the urbanisation boom exacerbates demand. Current building materials are unsustainable. Wood is too weak to replace steel and concrete. Solution: Woodoo creates augmented wood, a new material that is abundant, sustainable and extremely strong. Woodoo wood can be bent into any shape, used like touchscreens for electronics, and replace concrete to build massive wooden constructions with low environmental footprint. Innovation: Wood is treated to remove lignin, then impregnated with a proprietary polymer. This modifies wood’s structure, increasing strength and durability, while allowing light to penetrate. Commercialization: Woodoo will produce small batches for auto suppliers for interior panels and wooden touchscreens. It will later license technology to carmakers and sawmills to enable large-scale localized production. Demand: Interest from major premium car manufacturers and tier 1 suppliers. Markets: Auto outfitting, construction materials, lignin by-product. All large and growing. TAM of €125B for the automotive interior materials and €313B for wood construction. Company: Founded in 2016. Team of experienced managers and R&D experts. Ready to scale. Project: Woodoo will develop an auto interior part (a dashboard) from augmented wood. The outcome will be a ready-to-launch production process.',\n",
       " 'Social and political debates have repeatedly shown that we are now in a new religious era primarily marked by diversity. The religious diversity of European society – and in particular the visibility of Muslims in the public space – reveals that the geographical space is a key factor in the study of anti-Muslim discrimination. Indeed, Islamophobia is very much present and has intensified especially since the armed attack of Charlie Hebdo publishing offices (a French satirical magazine) in January 2015. By analysing the spatial effects of Islamophobia, we seek to more effectively assess the impact of Muslim presence throughout European society, and in particular in France and United Kingdom. More exactly in the SAMA project, I will identify the spaces where anti-Muslim acts have occurred, the spatial practices and the scales of belonging of these discriminated people, and the intersectional dimension of Islamophobia in both the Greater Paris and Greater London regions. In addition to recording the highest levels of anti-Muslim acts , these conurbations are also “socio-spatial laboratories” that offer a useful context for exploring and understanding the dynamics that revolve around religious discrimination. To do this, the researcher - Dr Kawtar NAJIB - is moving from France to Newcastle University in United Kingdom in order to undertake a research on “spaces of anti-Muslim acts in the Greater Paris and Greater London regions”. This project will offer significant insights for the fight against racism and hate crimes in Europe. The researcher will gain research expertise in Islamophobia, social geographies, inter-European comparative research and GIS (Geographical Information Systems).',\n",

       " 'Spreadsheet applications (such as Microsoft Excel \\\\ VBA) are heavily used in a wide range of fields including engineering, finance, management, statistics and health. However, they do not ensure robustness properties, thus spreadsheet errors are hard to avoid, common and potentially very costly. According to estimates, the annual cost of spreadsheet errors is around 7 billion dollars. For instance, in 2013, a series of basic spreadsheet errors at JPMorgan incurred 6 billion dollars trading losses. To avoid such problems, spreadsheet users need better support from rigorous tools, since the development of industrial spreadsheets typically involves multiple tabs, formulas, macros and data read from external sources (e.g., the internet). However, as of today, spreadsheet environment offer almost no verification support, and third party tools do not allow to reason correctly over macros, and future uses of existing formulas. The MemCAD ERC StG project opened the way to novel formal analysis techniques for spreadsheet applications. Indeed, the MemCAD project led to the design of powerful abstraction techniques to reason over complex data-structures such as tables as found in spreadsheets. During this project, we have implemented AiXL, a prototype that was able to analyze large public benchmarks. It uncovered defects that are beyond the scope of other approaches. We propose to leverage these results into a toolbox able to safely verify, optimize and maintain spreadsheets, so as to reduce the likelihood of errors. The envisioned toolbox relies on automatic and conservative semantic static analysis, so that it will report all occurrences of certain classes of errors. It will have an open architecture with plugins, and will easily extend to user specific properties. This works will take place in a partnership with MatrixLEAD, a startup created based on the results of the ERC MemCAD project. MatrixLEAD will provide industrial use-cases and commercialization plans.',\n",

This leads to opportunities for EU citizens to witness, analyze and monitor the functioning of their representative institutions, and tremendous challenges in making sense of the data, in particular by interpreting them in the context of specific needs. A citizen interested in an issue such as “undergraduate education” has no means to easily follow EU institution activity on it and compare it with activity and regulations in one's country. A lot of public information is available, however, acquiring a comprehensive picture and understanding the consequences, implications and correlations of this issue with respect to a bigger (European) arena is very difficult. IDEAA (Issue-Driven European Arena Analytics) will allow citizens to easily explore the trove of publicly available data. Its features are: (i) supply users with succinct and meaningful knowledge with respect to their issue of interest; (ii) allow users to interact with the provided knowledge to refine their information need and advance understanding; (iii) suggest interesting or unexpected aspects in the data and (iv) support the comparison of knowledge discovered from different data sources.

       " 'There is an increasing concern about statistical power in neuroscience research. Critically, an underpowered study has poor predictive power. Findings from a low-power study are unlikely to be reproducible, and thus a power analysis is a critical component of any paper. This project aims to promote and facilitate the use of power analyses.\\nA key component of a power analysis is the specification of an effect size. However, in neuroimaging, there is no standardised way to communicate effect sizes, which makes the choice of an appropriate effect size a formidable task. The best way today to perform a power analysis is by collecting a pilot data set, a very expensive practice. To eliminate the need for pilot data, we will develop a standardised measure of effect size taking into account the spatial variance and the uncertainty of the measurements. Communicating effect sizes in new publications will facilitate the use of power analyses.\\nTo further alleviate the need for pilot data, we will provide a library of effect sizes for different tasks and contrasts, using open data projects in neuroimaging. We will integrate our effect size estimator in open repositories NeuroVault and OpenfMRI. Consequently, these effect sizes can then serve as a proxy for a pilot study, and as such, a huge cost in the design of an experiment is eliminated.\\nA new experiment will not be identical to the open data and as such the hypothesised parameters might not be fully accurate. To address this issue, we present a flexible framework to analyse data mid-way without harming the control of the type I error rate. Such a procedure will allow re-evaluating halfway an experiment whether it is useful to continue a study, and how many more subjects are needed for statistically sound inferences.\\nTo make our methods maximally available, we will write a software suite including all these methods in different programming platforms and we will provide a GUI to further increase the use of power analyses.',\n",

       " \"The deposition of atmospheric dust is thought to provide nutrients that are essential for phytoplankton growth in large areas of the ocean, with implications for primary production and remaining oceanic food chain, as well as for the ocean's biological carbon pump. Amongst the main primary producers in open-ocean oligotrophic waters are the coccolithophores. By also including more opportunistic taxa that quickly respond to short-term changes linked to nutrient input, and by being both photosynthetic and calcifying, coccolithophores provide interesting perspectives as indicators of ocean fertilization by dust, and its contribution to the organic and inorganic oceanic carbon pumps. Given the huge amounts of Saharan-dust blown into and over the equatorial North Atlantic, a region where nitrogen fixation is co-limited by Fe and P, it is only likely to expect that dust will act as nutrient supplier for marine phytoplankton. Here, I propose to investigate the effects of Saharan dust deposition on the cell production, species composition, carbonate production and coccolith-Sr/Ca ratios on coccolithophore populations across the equatorial North Atlantic. The study will be based on seawater samples covering the entire photic layer and sediment trap samples collected between NW Africa and the Caribbean, complemented by a coccolithophore culturing exploring the response of key coccolithophore species to dust input. As the transatlantic array was lying directly underneath the largest dust plume originating from the African continent (12º N), and two events of dust deposition were clearly recorded during the sampling cruise, DUSTCO provides a unique in situ opportunity to investigate the potential of Saharan dust as a fertilizer. Ongoing multidisciplinary research in the region, offers an excellent context for this study.

Plenty of studies show that blocking autophagy by knocking out some of its essential genes leads to plants highly susceptible to this stresses (including heat and drought). However, there are much less studies about the effect of autophagy induction on the response of plants to stresses. Present situation of global warming is already having an effect in agriculture due to a rise in temperature and to water shortages. Therefore, generation of crops with higher resistance to heat and drought should be a priority nowadays. In this proposal I will study the role of autophagy in the maturation of one of the most important berry fruit in EU, Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa).

While this variety was influenced by human selection during plant domestication, it mainly reflects strategies of seed dispersal that evolved over millions of years. Despite the huge variation in fruit color, shape, and size, common patterns can still be identified, especially the repeated evolution of fleshy fruits (e.g. olives, apples, tomatoes). Though this pattern is well observed, we are still exploring the role of different factors and their selective pressures. These can be intrinsic, as evolution of inherited genes determining fruit traits, or extrinsic, as the environment. To date, studies have focused on one or two major factors at a time, but their relative contributions requires an integrative analysis.\\nFRUITFUL will dissect the evolution of fleshy fruits in the olive family. Oleaceae is the ideal study subject here because it presents a natural comparative set-up for fruit evolution: multiple lineages that independently evolved fleshy fruits; species living in a variety of environments; and diverse seed dispersers.

Going beyond these questions on diameter and expansion, there are at least three new directions I propose to follow: towards algorithms, towards geometric group theory, and towards number theory.\\n\\nSome of the main recent results in the area take the form of diameter bounds. Bounding a diameter amounts to showing that one can express any element of a group as a short product of generators. One of the main algorithmic questions consists in actually finding such an expression, and doing so rapidly. Links between geometric group theory (which studies growth in infinite groups) and the new combinatorial techniques ought to become stronger. Sofic and hyperlinear groups -- which arose in part from geometric group theory -- seem to invite a combinatorial approach.\\n\\nAdditive combinatorics has already shown its relevance to exponential sums, a key subject in analytic number theory. Can a newer perspective based on actions of groups give more general results? Short Kloosterman sums, which are particularly hard to bound, can be framed as a test case.\\n\\nI also plan to pursue related interests in automorphic forms - which are a classical example of the relevance of group actions to number theory - and model theory.',\n",

       " 'A major shortcoming of contemporary coastal research is the poor quantification of geological control in nearshore hydrodynamic and morphosedimentary processes along natural and developed coastal areas. This is particularly relevant given the global dominance of geologically-constrained coastlines, which face increasing risks driven by extreme storm events and growing societal pressures on the coast. This project aims to advance the knowledge of beach and nearshore morphodynamics within complex geomorphological settings, dominated by multi-dimensional geological control. The fundamental objective is to quantify the role and impact of nearshore geological control under energetic conditions. This will be accomplished by developing a ground-breaking approach, based on state-of-the-art surveying and monitoring methods to acquire unprecedented geophysical, morphological and hydrodynamic information of the beach and nearshore zones in geomorphological complex settings. New-generation process-based modelling will be implemented to explore wave-driven currents and patterns of sediment transport under realistic settings and conditions. Linking the sedimentary and geological framework of the beach and nearshore with field measurements and numerical modelling constitute a novel approach that will lead to fundamental advances in coastal geomorphology, further improving the ability to predict storm-induced erosion in geologically-controlled settings. To bring together these embedded scales of analysis and innovative approaches, this project is based on collaboration with international-leading experts in coastal geomorphology, marine geology and geophysics and coastal modelling. Expertise and skills developed by the fellow will contribute to an internationally-leading academic and research profile, promoting European research with global collaborations.',\n",
       " 'To execute accurate movements animals must continuously calibrate their behavior to changes in their bodies and the environment. This process, called sensorimotor adaption, is thought to take place by comparing sensory feedback with internal movement representations. How the brain compares sensory information to movements and updates behavior is not well understood for any animal species. We propose to tackle this problem by using the fruit fly, because, flies have a set of neurons (HS cells) that integrate movement with visual information, being ideal candidates to convey information of self-movement during learning. Also, in a wide array of species spanning from the C. elegans to mice, including the fruit fly, when animals transition to low locomotion states serotonergic neurons are active, being possible substrates to calibrate movements to visual feedback. Here, we propose a set of experiments to inhibit and activate HS cells and serotonergic neurons and casually link their activity to sensorimotor adaption. Also, we will record the neural activity from these neurons to understand how the neural signals in HS cells and serotonergic neurons change during motor learning. This project will provide a detailed mechanistic description on how representations of self-movement in the brain are modulated by serotonin and used for motor learning. This knowledge will be useful to inspire new motor learning theories and understand how the brain generates behavior.',\n",

The simplest nitroaromatics compounds are nitrobenzene, 1-nitronaphthalene, and 2-nitronaphthalene. The study of such systems will then constitute the most natural starting point in order to investigate the properties of the nitroaromatics group of compounds. Moreover these three particular molecules are characterized by important and in some case unique photophysical and photochemical properties. For example, 1NN is the organic compound with the fastest multiplicity change ever measured. Recently, an increasing interest in NB has occurred in relation to the so-called roaming radical reactions, which are a new type of reactions that follow a mechanism not contemplated in transition-state theory. With the present project, we aim to characterize the photophysics and photochemistry of the related systems NB, 1NN and 2NN under UVA/UVB exposure through the computation of ab initio quantum chemical dynamics simulations. In particular we will study: their main decay paths, the intersystem-crossing process toward the triplet manifold, the mechanisms leading to the photoisomerization of the nitro into a nitrite group, including the possibility of roaming radical photoisomerization, and the competition among all the mentioned processes.',\n",
       " 'The societal burden of brain disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease is enormous and is considered one of the world’s most important health challenges. They affect millions of people worldwide and the annual healthcare costs are high and are increasing with the aging population. There is an immediate need to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of these disorders. Particularly, the important role of the brain-specific immune cells called microglia needs to be unravelled. Microglia become activated upon inflammation in the brain and its activation covers a wide spectrum of activation states, ranging from stimulating the inflammation (pro-inflammatory status) to reducing the inflammation (anti-inflammatory status). To fill the current knowledge gaps regarding the role and regulation of the different activation states of microglia, I will use positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. My host institution has recently succeeded in developing a PET tracer for imaging pro-inflammatory microglia. However, there is no complementary tracer existing for selective imaging of the anti-inflammatory status. In the proposed project, I will develop a PET tracer targeting the P2Y12 receptor, a receptor over-expressed on anti-inflammatory microglia. To achieve this, I will use an interdisciplinary approach spanning from computational medicinal chemistry through synthetic organic chemistry and radiochemistry to in vitro and eventually in vivo evaluation studies in an animal model for MS. A successful PET tracer will find widespread application in the research regarding brain disorders and ultimately guide drug development and treatment opportunities. On a personal level, the proposed project will have a substantial impact on my career, as new skills in neuroimaging, computer-aided drug design and in vitro evaluation techniques will complement my previous expertise in organic chemistry, radiochemistry and PET tracer development.',\n",

Our key product, the N-IF mouse, is a unique animal model that spontaneously develops fibrosis which is preceded by chronic inflammation and exhibits the same course of fibrotic disease progression as in humans, a unique feature that has been an ultimate need demanded by the pharmaceutical industry for many years. \\n\\nThere are no efficient therapies aimed against fibrotic diseases despite the high prevalence among the world population and the huge impact on human health. To date, drug development has been hampered due to the lack of good and reliable preclinical models that better resemble human fibrotic disease conditions. \\nThe N-IF mouse eliminates the problems of currently available animal models that are time-consuming, labour-intensive to induce fibrosis and have a low reproducibility. Its unique features will allow to shorten test protocols by 4-8 weeks, increase robustness of tests due to its 100% reproducibility and minimize the number of experimental animals needed. Reductions in experiment time and in mice numbers directly translate into a 25 - 50% decrease in the overall costs of preclinical testing of anti-fibrotic drugs.\\nWe have already technically validated the N-IF mouse as a model for liver fibrosis and have acquired two clients. The objective of the Phase 1 project is to conduct a feasibility study and prepare for further validation studies of the mouse model in order to establish the pathology of NASH, renal and pulmonary fibrosis that will be conducted as part of Phase 2, enlarging our pipeline models for fibrotic diseases and opening doors to new segments of the fibrotic diseases market.',\n",
       " 'Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are incurable, debilitating conditions, arise mid-late in life, represent an enormous health and socioeconomic burden and no therapies exist. An enigmatic finding in NDs is the early and selective alteration in intrinsic excitability of vulnerable neurons paralleling changes in its circuitry. However, a gap in understanding exists in ND field about the cause of these alterations and whether these modifications regulate degenerative pathomechanisms. Our recent study, examining mechanisms of Purkinje cell (PC) degeneration in Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) revealed that the earliest cerebellar alterations occur in the major excitatory inputs onto PCs, the climbing fibers (CFs). Based on this, we propose a novel three-step model of neurodegeneration: First, suboptimal functioning of the presynaptic inputs initiates signaling deficits in target PCs. Second, those alterations trigger maladaptive responses such as altered intrinsic PC excitability, thus amplifying pathogenic cascades. Third, at network level progressive dysfunction triggers compensatory synaptic modifications within the cerebellar circuitry. In this proposal, we will test our new hypothesis for NDs on SCA1 and this will be the first study to test circuit-dependency in NDs by selectively silencing presynaptic inputs and examining molecular responses in the postsynaptic neuron. Specifically, we will 1) Identify the dysfunctional CF associated molecular signature in PCs. 2) Elucidate mechanisms involved in altering intrinsic PC excitability. 3) Map the connectome for a structural correlate of the pathology. Using conditional mouse models, pharmacogenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics and connectomics, we will delineate molecular alterations that govern disease from compensatory alterations. Our systematic approach will not only impact SCA related therapies but the entire spectrum of NDs and has the potential to change the conceptual approach of future studies on NDs.',\n",
       " 'Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases and are caused by proteinaceous infectious particles termed prions. The infectious agent of prion diseases has been identified decades ago, but the actual cellular processes that subsequently cause neurons to degenerate remain poorly understood. \\nI propose the systematic analysis of molecular changes in various organs from prion-infected mice. I will profile translation rates and mRNA abundance on a genome-wide scale via ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing, respectively. This will allow me to identify molecular changes during prion disease progression and to decipher the relative contributions of differential transcriptional and translational regulation to them. By relating these changes to prion titers and clinical symptoms I will establish correlations between molecular changes and disease progression. This will identify single genes as well as gene networks that are linked to disease pathology. The analysis of various organs at multiple time points following prion inoculation will enable me to dissect the dynamics of disease progression and the role and interplay of the different organs in pathophysiology. \\nI will further study the causal role of identified candidate genes in prion pathology. To this end, I will investigate the effect of their knock-down and knock-out on prion clearance, replication and toxicity, using a previously established fully automated digital prion infectivity assay. This approach will identify a comprehensive list of genes that are differentially regulated during prion disease progression and that are important for different aspects of prion pathogenesis. This will not only help to better understand the manifestation of prion disease and other neurodegenerative diseases but also provide potential starting points for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.',\n",
       " 'Custom-Made Implants (CMIs) are considered to be a superior solution for the treatment of patients with rare and severe clinical conditions since they ensure better fit, lower surgical invasiveness, shorter surgery time, faster healing, reduce risks of infection, joint dislocation and revision surgeries leading to lower total pathology treatment costs. Also, they provide fuller restoration of patient’s physical performance and higher quality of life by reducing or avoiding side effects. Thus, CMIs provide added value for all - patients, surgeons, medical institutions and health insurance funds. However, CMIs currently fail to achieve large-scale commercial success due to high price, long lead times and dominated surgical approach oriented towards standard solutions. Currently CMIs in value account for only ~1.4% of implant market.\\nOrtho Baltic has developed the technological infrastructure for CMIs design, manufacturing and validation. It consist of surgeon-manufacturer co-creation and communication tool MICE (Medical Implants Customization Engine) and factory floor management system MC Dynamics (Mass Customization Dynamics) that together provide a chance to proceed to mass customization of CMIs. This will lead to the significant decrease of manufacturing costs and lead times. Already today Ortho Baltic offers CMIs for a ~21% lower price than standard modular implants. However, with the successful implementation of the project it could offer CMIs twice cheaper (for an average price of €3260) by 2023 and with lead time < 2 weeks. The profit is expected to be around 1,5 million in 2023. To reach this, during Phase 2 project Ortho Baltic will expand the functionalities of both systems, transfer them to new technology platforms (MICE - to web based platform),pilot them as well as develop supporting tools for CMI application in surgical treatment (clinical decision support and training software MICE Trainer and international curriculum for medical students and surgeons).',\n",

In particular, heart failure (HF) accounts for almost 1.1 million deaths each year. \\nIn early ’90 there was the formal recognition that inflammatory mediators are activated in the setting of HF by a sentinel description of inflammatory cytokines in patients with heart failure. After that, a growing interest in the role of biomarkers in regulating cardiac structure and function, particularly regarding their potential role in disease progression in heart failure, raised up. Nowadays, there are evidences on that. \\nGenerally, biomarkers are determined mostly in plasma or in blood, rather than in saliva. In fact, despite of that very few of them have been currently studied in saliva, saliva has to be considered as an important diagnostic and prognostic medium for minimally invasive tools. Indeed a great progress in disclosing the complete salivary proteome has carried to the identification of more than 3000 different proteins. \\nScope of this project is to develop a tool for HF-biomarkers detection through saliva.

To this end the hosting institution and the experienced researcher complete each other and make the research and development on this cross related filed feasible. The proposed device will allow a mass screening for the prevention of HF and other pathologies related to the cardiovascular system.\\nWithin this project, the experienced researcher will be able both to enlarge her knowledge in the design of CMOS imagers by implementing innovative photon detection techniques and to approach a growing branch of microelectronics, such as the bioMEMs one.',\n",
       " 'Cataracts is a common ocular pathology involving an increase in the amount of intraocular light scattering. This causes vision impairment by blurring retinal images and reducing their contrast. The current treatment for this pathology is cataract surgery, which is an invasive procedure with possible side effects, such as corneal edema, infection or retinal detachment among others. In this work, we propose a non-invasive approach to improve vision through the cataractous lenses based on the manipulation of the light wavefront incident on the eye, that in the final end will be integrated into head mounted devices. The goal of this project is to develop a solid scientific frame for this technique to work, together with an initial working device. In our approach we propose the use of the natural fluorescence of the retina as feedback for the wavefront optimization algorithm, which allows the optimization of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the eye. The optical memory effect of the cataracts will be characterized and used in the strategy to project images onto the retina with the maximal optimized PSF. A compact device capable of measuring and correcting vision will be developed in the final steps, preparing the ground for clinical tests, commercialization of the device and its integration with head mounted devices for practical vision correction through cataracts.',\n",
       " 'High luminosities at future particles colliders, such as the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), will come at the price of a dramatic increase in the number of concurrent interactions of beam particles (referred to as pileup) per crossing in the experiments, implying serious challenges to the reconstruction of events. Due to the spread of the proton bunches along the beamline, collisions vertices at the HL-LHC are spread out over about 5 cm along the beam direction and about 160 ps in time. At the vertex densities foreseen at the HL-LHC, some vertices and the associated particles are so close to be merged by the track reconstruction forming fake jets of high transverse momentum. Moreover, the random overlap of energy deposits from neutral particles (mainly photons), that cannot be tied via a track to any vertex, will deteriorate the calorimeter performance in terms of energy measurement and particle identification, as particles appear to be less isolated. A promising tool advocated to mitigate the effects of pileup consists in complementing the high transverse (spatial) granularity of the detectors with extreme time resolution (of the order of 10 ps), that would allow energy deposits coming from different interaction vertices to be resolved in time.\\nThe goal of this project is the definition of a viable way to exploit precision timing in event reconstruction at HL-LHC and integrate and/or complement the calorimeter system of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) with ultimate timing capabilities. The project will address both software aspects, with the development of innovative and dedicated algorithms for event reconstruction in 5 dimensions (space-time and energy), and hardware aspects, with the study of microchannel plates as candidate sensitive detector for a dedicated fast timing layer, eventually embedded in a preshower, to assist the calorimeters in single particle and photon timing.',\n",

       " 'In radiation therapy, proton therapy has a more favourable dose distribution than conventional radiotherapy with photons and electrons. However, in order to fully exploit this dosimetric advantage, it would be required to verify the range of protons in the patient with mm accuracy. The most used strategy for in-vivo range verification in protontherapy relies on positron emission tomography (PET) activation. As they progress through the patient, proton beams undergo nuclear reactions than can produce radioactive isotopes, some of which are positron-emitters. This induced radiactivity can be detected in commercial or dedicated PET scanners and used to deduce the delivered dose distribution in the patient.\\n\\nWhile a promising technique, two main challenges have so far limited its clinical implementation: first, the proton interaction cross sections of the elements making up the body (C, O, N, H) are relatively low, which causes the positron dissintegration counts detected by the PET scanners to be about 1 or 2 orders of magnitude lower than the usual numbers in nuclear medicine. And second, the spatial and temporal distributions of PET emitters follow a very complex relation with the dose depositions which complicate the range verification process.\\n\\nThe CAPPERAM project aims at solving these two problems by using Zn-based contrast agents in the patient during irradiation.

Despite coordinated efforts from researchers and clinicians alike, the neurobiological substrates of depression remain largely unknown. As a result, therapeutic options against depression are inadequate.\\nUsing a valid preclinical model, I recently demonstrated that depression alters the molecular composition of astrocytes and the organization of extracellular matrix (ECM), an assembly of molecules that are primarily synthesized and released by astrocytes. This results in disrupted information relay in the hippocampus and in cognitive impairment, both commonly seen in depressed patients. Thus, my work suggests a role of astrocytic (dys)function in the depressive state. \\nIn the proposed project, I aim to unravel the contribution of astrocytes in the pathophysiology of depression. First, I will address how the depressive state affects astrocyte proteome, morphology and function.

The reason is these machines are becoming more reliable, but they ultimately lack the functionality and usability that would be needed to become a real mainstream technology. Plasmics was founded with the sole goal to overcome these limitations, by creating the disruptive Local Production Unit (LPU), from which KOBOLD is the first product we are developing and plan to commercialize. Functionality is achieved thanks to KOBOLD's multi-material versatile printing capability, thanks to our modular cartridge system (patented) allowing printing complex objects using as many materials as cartridges are coupled to the printer. Up to 5 cartridges can be coupled to KOBOLD, with the additional advantage of being able to upgrade KOBOLD with new materials as they become available, instead of having to invest on a new printer or acquiring extra technical capabilities. Usability is achieved because KOBOLD does not require prior expertise in 3D printing to unfold its full potential, thanks to its user-friendly online software platform enabling the user to store, slice their designs and to keep their IP and collected models safe, while allowing object printing from any device and from anywhere. With KOBOLD, we anticipate to grow our company's revenue to €13.8 million by 2025, whilst creating 20 new direct jobs.

This, together with the lower production costs, will give a relevant momentum to the European mussel cultivation sector, which will be in a renovated position to compete again for the export shares.\\nHowever, environment is the greatest beneficiary. The wood degradation and the chemicals used to maintain the raft disrupt the marine ecosystem. Formex® has a footprint 100 times smaller and it would allow the mussel cultivation to become a zero-emissions sector. The material used (UHC) is comparable to an artificial stone and does not need any chemical protective layer. \\nPotential users and authorities have perceived the added value of this innovation, which has the key strengths to become the leader of this market. With this project this excellence will be demonstrated in large scale to reach the customers.',\n",
       " 'The New Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) are widely advertised, with CAGR 15%/year, as they lack the necessity for monitoring of the patient. It is now corrected by increased levels of renal failure and hemorrhagic events. The project is focused on the validation and industrialization of new IVD POC device that will provide solutions to monitor low molecular weight heparin and NOACs which are not monitored by any existing POC systems. The proposed solution is improving patient care and management and lowering the increasing cost of centralized patient management related to the ageing of the population. This opens a business opportunity for our company since no POC device exists capable of performing similar diagnostic. Our solution has no direct competitors worldwide. The expected outcome is a complete diagnostic system based on proprietary microfluidic Core Technology patented by iLine Microsystems. This will extend the diagnostic range of the POC anticoagulation therapies that now can only be reached by multistep reactions run in centralized labs and accelerate the development of future tests. The feasibility study will focus on the business plan. Market size and niches can be measured for NOACs and their use in patient’s management. Both new lines of product are aiming at distinct market segments, emergencies, hospital tests or independent laboratories. Commercialization will follow the established strategy of sales via worldwide distributors. This approach eliminates the market entry barrier in hospitals and health care. We are building the clinical network including KOLs in the fields of hematology, cardiology and Critical Care where majority of the NOACs are prescribed and monitoring is vital. The proposed solution, due to its modular design and flexibility, has the unique potential for customization and improvements.

       " 'With the financial crisis stepping up the pressure on labour regimes around Europe, and with the European national economies increasingly subject to the vagaries of an uncertain Chinese growth, questions traditionally of interest only to Chinese labour specialists and rights advocates are taking a whole new dimension. Chinese labour issues have ceased to be local matters and have assumed a particular urgency, entering much of the political rhetoric of the European countries. Such diffused presence of Chinese labour in the European imaginary raises many questions and requires a thorough investigation. In particular, in the past few years, much has been written about a “rights awakening” allegedly undergoing among internal migrant workers in China. But how do Chinese workers perceive their rights? What role do Chinese state and non-state actors play in shaping this perception? And, more important, how will these shifting dynamics of Chinese labour activism affect the future of China as a “world factory”? Research that answers these questions is still scarce. The purpose of this study is threefold: a) analyse the expectations of Chinese migrant workers toward work hours and salaries, on the background of the minimum standards mandated by the current labour legislation; b) deconstruct the role played by different actors in shaping these expectation, with a particular attention to the role of the central and local state, the union, civil society organizations and foreign enterprises; c) address the implications of the rising expectations of the Chinese workers for EU investments in China and for the future of the country as a “world factory”. This research will not only give a meaningful contribution to the academic debate, but will also provide European policy-makers, companies, trade unions and labour NGOs with much needed knowledge on how to address Chinese labour issues in this new phase of the globalization process.',\n",

It is considered a premium material in the fashion, upholstery and automobile industries. The leather production market, with an estimated value of €100 billion is projected to grow by 6.2% to 2023.  Sadly, the leather industry is one of the most polluting, due to the hide and skin tanning processes (excess water use, chemical spills, millions of CO2 emissions, worker health problems, skin diseases, filthy working conditions especially for women). Sustainability in leather production is a must in this day and age when eco-labels are sought after by brands to stand out from the crowd, as consumers demand higher quality standards. Currently, the one and only way to produce real leather is by taking the skin from an animal. Yes, alternatives like PVC and plant-based products exist, but their composition and properties are nowhere near that of real leather. Hence, they can never be adequate substitutes. At Gelatex, we have developed a cutting-edge new method of synthesizing layers of collagen, made from gelatin, creating a fabric of unprecedented quality, chemically equivalent to leather. Gelatex is the first to deliver this new animal-like leather without the need for tanning. The material is designed and configured following the industry requirements on tensile strength, resistance (to tear, to flexing, to puncture), good heat insulation, water vapor permeability and comfort. Ours is a scalable and efficient process allowing for Gelatex to be sold below the cost of current leather. We will can sell our tailor-made leather in colors thicknesses and sizes desired by our customers (manufacturers of leather articles). We thus expect to achieve revenues of €10 million in just 3 years. As our production facilities expand alongside a possible licensing model, our tech has the potential to generate €2 billion in revenue in only 10 years.',\n",

The international wool trade in the Renaissance provides an almost unique lens through which to view the creation of the earliest global brands because the provenance and quality of the wool itself, and thus the reputation of its purveyors, were the most crucial factors in the profitability of manufacturing and exporting firms. Florentine merchants played an important role in the global wool trade and in global brand creation from the very beginning. MARKS-MEDICI will study the sixteenth-century woolen cloth trade of Medici family firms with the Near East, where the exploding Turkish demand for luxury cloth and good Turkish-Florentine relations opened up important new markets; it will place this trade in the context of changing English-Florentine commercial relations, since England was the most important supplier of raw wool for luxury production until the late sixteenth century; and, most importantly, it will focus in a ground-breaking way on the role played by trademarks in marketing and exporting luxury goods long before the existence of international intellectual property and trademark protection conventions. Medici entrepreneurs, members of the influential Florentine Wool Guild (Arte della Lana), extensively used trade marks (called segni, “signs”) to identify, protect, and market their firms and their products in a highly-competitive marketplace. A two-year Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship will uniquely allow the ER to analyse an important and largely unknown collection of Medici account books and, crucially, to contextualize the Medici business in the broader history of the wool trade in England and the Low Countries and in terms of the Turkish demand for luxury cloth.'\",\n",

Cement production alone represents 5% of all global human-created CO2 emissions. The market for soil stabilisation hasn’t been disrupted in decades, with toxic industrial fluids such as acrylamide, and heavy equipment still required for manufacture and application. It is widely agreed that new technologies are desperately needed to reduce CO2 emissions of the cement industry by 70% by 2050 as well as to eliminate the use of toxic chemicals from soil stabilisation applications. Our innovation, BioPetrify, offers a natural soil stabilisation solution for use in both new and repair construction projects. BioPetrify offers the first liquid agent able to turn soil into stone, harnessing the power of a harmless microorganism in an industrially scalable way, to achieve compressive strength of conventional construction materials, sustainably. No heavy machinery needed, no CO2 released. BioPetrify is readily integrable into existing construction processes and time-scales and tailorable to each unique soil and construction type. Application is even possible under existing structures, where it is 10x cheaper than existing solutions. BioPetrify not only represents the solution to the environmental and physical limitations of current stabilisation methods, but offers a lever for market expansion of current stabilisation material providers (e.g. adding strength to geotextile), with whom we are already partnering.

       " 'CFD simulation tools are key in the automotive industry, as they lead to faster development times, lower costs, higher added value and higher overall innovation capabilities. However, their complexity (requiring highly specialized engineers for preparation and data interpretation) and high license/hardware costs hinder their implementation by a larger number of companies, as SMEs cannot afford such investments.  \\nIn response to this need identified by our customers in the automotive industry (Audi, Magna, AVL) for affordable and user-friendly CFD software, at ESS Steyr we are developing SENSE: an innovative modular CFD solver which uses Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) running on GPUs. The use of SPH together with our intuitive GUI simplifies the process, compared to the Finite Element Method and Finite Volume Method used in most current CFD tools, eliminating time consuming pre- and post-processing and reducing simulation run times to 1/10th. As the first modular CFD solution in the market, SENSE provides SENSE users easy-to-use modules targeted at the one application they require, optimized to their needs and with pre-set boundary conditions, instead of having to buy complex, predefined toolboxes with features they will never use. Moreover, as it runs on GPUs instead of CPUs, hardware requirements are much lower, reducing costs from € 400,000 to € 40,000. \\nIn this way, we aim to disrupt the automotive market by facilitating the SMEs in the industry (over 2,500 only in Europe) with the access to the much-needed simulation software in their day-to-day operations: with SENSE, SMEs will operate more cost- and time efficient, become more competitive and be at the forefront of innovation, thereby boosting the efficiency and competitiveness of the European Automotive Industry. \\nIn addition, SENSE will also boost the growth of our company, enabling revenues of €85.87 million, a Return of Investment of 8.4 and triplicating our current staff by 2023.',\n",
       " \"In Europe alone, about 20,000 oil spills were detected over a period of 6 years. Oil spills turn into major disasters because no immediate containment equipment is housed on-board large ships and oil rigs, and nothing that can prevent oil from spreading during the first hours of a spill and thus the damage grows exponentially with time of response.\\nOILBLOCK project goal is to address the highly significant ecological, social and economic problems caused by oil spills. HARBO’s system starts operating within minutes of spill detection. In less than 30 minutes, it deploys 2,000 meters of a revolutionary containment boom (floating barrier), smallest and lightest than any of current solutions. HARBO’s patented technology has already been proven at the world's best testing facility for oil spill response. It is the first that can be pre-installed at standby positions in any place at risk for oil spills and therefore will multiply oil recovery rates and significantly decrease the environmental impact of spills.\\nThe solution has raised the interest of different stakeholders such as emergency response organizations, coast guards, shipping lines, oil rig operators and coastal infrastructure facilities among others.\\nOILBLOCK project focus on searching strong European partnerships for ensuring the demonstration of the system in different real scenarios and closing commercial agreements for a fast commercialization once project is finished. \\nThe project will help to demonstrate first units for early adopters and therefore will put HARBO in the path to reach a sales rate of 450 units/year by 2021 with an expected annual turnover of €70 million due to system sales. This growth will be reflected in the recruitment of up to 50 new employees in next five years. By 2028 sales are expected to boost until 2,500 units/year due to the influence of regulators considering HARBO’s technology as a benchmark for oil spill primary containment.\",\n",

Over the last two years, ALLATHERM has developed ALTOM, a hermetically sealed closed 2-phase heat transfer loop for electronic components cooling. ALLATHERM has taken the 2-phase spacecraft thermal control concept and brought it to terrestrial vehicles with a modular ground-breaking approach. ALTOM is an efficient (fully passive), standardised, flexible (multiple configurations), cost-effective (>400€saved per vehicle), robust (no moving parts) and non-toxic system that manages thermal control in power electronics for terrestrial applications (electric and hybrid vehicles-EV/HEVs-).\\nAccording to the IEA, EV/HEVs stock is projected to reach 200 Million units by 2030. To achieve these numbers, EV/HEVs powertrain manufactures are required to increase the efficiency, lower cost and standardise their thermal management systems for the electronic components (engine, batteries, and invertor).  ALTOM heat loops, which have already proven its capacity to solve all these needs, will reach the market by 2020 selling 65,000 units and generating a profit of 11.7M€ during the first 5 years. ALTOM will directly target EV/HEV and powertrain manufacturers’ needs all across Europe since their market is not focused on a specific geographical area. With ALTOM market launch we will contribute to the achievement of 60% emission reduction in transport within the European Union by 2050, targeted in the 2011 Transport White Paper. Moreover, ALTOM boosts Europe´s transition towards a circular economy as it is framed in the “end-of-life vehicles”, “batteries and accumulators” and “waste on electrical and electronic equipment”, encouraging global competitiveness and sustainable economic growth.',\n",
       " 'During rail and road tunnel construction/refurbishment, the initial investment required for lighting system installation, including emergency lighting systems (ELS) amounts to an average 6% of total tunnel construction cost. Current ELS power supply circuits force lights to remain on for long hours when not needed: when power is turned off manually, existing circuits keep ELS on (powered by batteries). This leads to needless energy consumption and fast battery deterioration. We, at Uni-light LED, have developed Smartunnel, a new smart LED ELS for tunnels under construction/refurbishment, which turns off when light is not needed. Our smart switch and intelligent control allow discrimination between unintentional power outage and intentional interruption, so that emergency lights are lit only under the first scenario. This prevents excessive battery exhaustion/recharging cycles thus making Smartunnel the longest-life ELS on the market (10 years, 80% reduction in battery waste). Smartunnel offers 20-30% increased energy efficiency leading to effective savings of €13,000/3km per year. Our flicker-free and electromagnetic interference-free lights improve visibility and reduce health issues, enhancing safety and security for tunnel workers. Conveniently, Smartunnel can use existing wiring installations to power emergency lights, curbing the cost of new wiring in existing tunnels. We already commercialise 7 lighting product types, based on our patented LED light Driver and Thermal Management Technology for illumination in agriculture, industry and on ships, thus far reaching 100 companies in the UK, Sweden, Germany and Austria. The success of our existing systems has funded Smartunnel development. Following the optimisation of our design into a pilot for phase 2 validation under real conditions. We aim to achieve a tunnelling construction market share of 21 % in Europe as well as 8 % in USA by 2024, creating at least 20 new jobs at Uni-light LED in the process.',\n",

The mission of noonee is to develop and distribute exoskeleton-like devices specifically tailored to the needs of industry. Caused by the demographic change, the European workforce is continuously ageing. This represents a huge challenge for the employment across all sectors. Since older workers are becoming a growing part of the workforce and people must work for longer, appropriate measures to improve working conditions and obtain health are becoming a main priority. Even though workers in manufacturing plants are constantly ranked among the occupations with highest prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, the problem of bad workplace ergonomics is still very present. With our first product, the Chairless Chair, we are directly addressing the physical needs of workers in manufacturing and processing industries. The idea is to provide lowerback support to workers that normally must stand all day long and often in awkward body postures. Through close collaboration with large automotive and manufacturing companies, the Chairless Chair was specifically tailored to fit the needs of these workers in terms of usability, health benefits and user acceptance. In parallel, the Chairless Chair helps companies to save high amounts of costs related to sick or absent workers, fluctuating performance and the establishment of age-neutral and ergonomic workplaces. Based on the present first-mover advantage and a product that perfectly fits the nerve of time, the full commercialisation of our Chairless Chair will position noonee as market leader in the segment for wearable ergonomics mechatronic devices. To achieve this goal, the fast establishment of a European and global distribution channel is foreseen. During the first 5 years of commercialisation, we expect to generate cumulative revenues of 32 million € and establish at least 37 new jobs at noonee and more than 30 new jobs at our global distributors.',\n",
       " 'Globalization is expanding economic borders rapidly. Barriers to trade are now lower than ever and this has led to the creation of many truly global goods and asset markets. And yet globalization is changing political borders only slowly. The second wave of globalization that started after WWII found the world organized into a set of states or centralized\\njurisdictions that often go beyond cultural borders but that clearly fall short of economic borders. These centralized jurisdictions still hold most of the political and decision-making power. \\n\\nThis growing mismatch between markets and states lowers the quality of economic policymaking. Since constituencies are located inside the state, governments tend to disregard effects of economic policies that are felt beyond the political border.\\nThe result is a worsening in policymaking that could seriously mitigate the gains from globalization and even turn them into losses. The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of how this growing mismatch between economic and political borders affects economic policy and political structure. In particular, it focuses on the inefficiencies this mismatch creates and on how should we (“the citizens of the world”) handle them.\\n\\nThe project is organized around two themes. The first one is the handling of enforcement externalities. One of the key roles of governments is to enforce contracts. When these contracts involve domestic and foreign residents, governments have the temptation to enforce selectively so as to shift income to domestic residents at the expense of foreigners. The second theme is the evolution of political structure. The world is currently organized into state or centralized jurisdictions. This project studies the hypothesis that globalization leads to an alternative political structure based on a set of overlapping jurisdictions.',\n",

Anticancer agents are often complex biopharmaceuticals that are expensive to manufacture, requiring use of living cell lines with difficult-to-control production processes, limited yields and time-consuming purification steps. There is an urgent unmet need for an improved manufacturing process of  biopharmaceuticals, to meet the high demand and lower the price of oncologic treatments. We will revolutionize the way biopharmaceuticals are produced by developing a microalgae based biorefinery platform. These biorefineries will utilize genetically engineered microalgae to efficiently produce pharmaceutical agents. Microalgae are photosynthetic micro-organisms that have unique advantages as biopharmaceutical production systems, including high growth rate, ease of cultivation and low growth costs, enabling cost effective and scalable yield of active ingredients. These will be recombinant proteins, small molecules or therapeutic peptides, starting with Paclitaxel as showcase, one of the world’s best sold anticancer drugs used as the first line treatment of a several solid tumours.

It frees the public space, supports local businesses, reduces search travel, generates revenue, increases safety, supports urban planning and can make cities more attractive. The general concept is to take the very best parking management examples, contexts and expertise in Europe, learn and profit from these, and transfer them on a large scale and in the best way possible to new cities . This covers raising awareness and gaining acceptance among relevant stakeholders; building capacity, particularly among cities that have difficulty in picking up such policies; stimulating further innovation; and achieving wide roll-out and transferability. Park4SUMP will work on traffic and travel avoidance; it will support less car dependent lifestyles and put into practise innovations in planning and location policy.  It will also optimise the use of existing infrastructure. Furthermore the modal shift towards more efficient modes like  walking, cycling and public transport will be encouraged. Convincing arguments to incorporate parking management can be given : it has low costs, it pays for itself, it delivers money, it is easy to implement and to modify and it can be done in incremental steps. The main expected impact will be cities with strongly improved parking policies that are creatively used to improve the quality of life and business in cities and develop the cities in a more sustainable way.

Their continuous improvement is key to the achievement of business objectives, be it with respect to efficiency, quality, compliance, or agility. Accordingly, a common task for process analysts is to discover and assess process improvement opportunities, i.e. changes to one or more processes, which are likely to improve them with respect to one or more performance measures. Current approaches to discover process improvement opportunities are expert-driven. In these approaches, data are used to assess opportunities derived from experience and intuition rather than to discover them in the first place. Moreover, as the assessment of opportunities is manual, analysts can only explore a fraction thereof. \\n\\nPIX will build the foundations of a new generation of process improvement methods that do not exclusively rely on guidelines and heuristics, but rather on a systematic exploration of a space of possible changes derived from process execution data. Specifically, PIX will develop conceptual frameworks and algorithms to analyze process execution data in order to discover process changes corresponding to possible improvement opportunities, including changes in the control-flow dependencies between activities, partial automation of activities, changes in resource allocation rules, or changes in decision rules that may reduce wastes or negative outcomes. Each change will be associated with a multi-dimensional utility, thus allowing us to map a process improvement problem to an optimization problem over a multidimensional space. Given this mapping, PIX will develop efficient and incremental methods to search through said spaces in order to find Pareto-optimal groups of changes. The outputs will be embodied in a first-of-its-kind tool for automated process improvement discovery, which will lift the focus in the field of process mining from analyzing as-is processes to designing to-be processes.',\n",

This causes bleedings, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a dramatic reduction of the quality of life. The intestinal barrier is normally a very well organised structure in which the cells are tightly connected maintaining the barrier. Moreover, IBD lesions compromise this intestinal organization and increases intestinal permeability, which is called leaky gut syndrome (LGS) being also a pre-disposing factor for several other health problems. LGS compromises digestion of food particles and removal of toxic waste products, and allows bacteria to 'leak' through the intestine to the blood stream. Besides in IBD, LGS is also common in people with health conditions such as obesity, rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes. Even though IBD poses significant threats to a patients’ health and a heavy direct and indirect economic burden, diagnosis of this condition is still limited assessing indirect parameters like general inflammation markers in plasma and stool and evaluation based by comparison on the patients symptoms description. The direct measures are also performed but are restricted to very invasive methods like biopsy or solely qualitative like MRI and microcapsule colonoscopy. In this way it is reported in several clinical articles a clear need for new diagnostic methods in IBD reinforced by facts like 35% of the performed surgeries for treatment revealing unnecessary and 1.9 billion people worldwide at risk for early lesions and IBD development not being diagnosed. In this way clinical practice urges for new methods for the assessment of lesions in the intestinal wall. Lifetag’s has developed PermeAbility, a new proprietary test to measure intestinal permeability to better select patients at high risk of IBD , leading to better informed clinical decision making, diagnosis, and treatment.'\",\n",

Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) that enter the blood stream on their way to potential metastatic sites are of obvious interest to evaluate correctly patient treatment and therefore influence outcome. CTCs have been identified in bladder, gastric, prostate, lung, breast and colon cancer. The only FDA approved CTCs detection system is Veridex’ CellSearch, which detects only epithelial cancer cells using antibody labelling. Recent evidence showed that non-epithelial cancer cells, which are not detected by CellSearch, are of critical importance in cancer progression. \\n\\nThe idea: Our CTC detection method is based, instead of on antibody labelling, on metabolic features of cancer cells, thus providing potential for detecting both epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cells. Cancer cells induce environmental changes; e.g. in aerobic conditions most cancer cells display a high rate of glycolysis with lactate production in the cytosol, known as the Warburg effect.  By separating cells into micro-droplets of pico-liter volume using micro-fluidic water-in-oil emulsions and by characterising the microenvironment surrounding them, CTCs are detected by probing for environmental changes using pH sensitive dyes or enzymatic lactate assays. Our inexpensive diagnostic method provides a way to count and isolate CTCs without any labelling while maintaining cells alive and intact for further studies.\\n\\nThe project: “A CACTUS” is meant to assess the feasibility of commercialising the developed method for counting and sorting CTCs and develop a proper commercialisation strategy.

Businesses of all sizes are moving their key processes to external colocation datacenters. “The global datacenter colocation size is expected to grow from USD 31.52 billion in 2017 to USD 62.30 billion by 2022, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14.60%.”\\nAt the same time, datacenter resources require monitoring and management to ensure proper business continuity. To that extent, IDEAS project will enable datacenters to benefit significantly from the value add of DCIM (datacenter Infrastructure Management) solutions at a fraction of the cost and complexity of today.\\nDCIM features will be accessible through a service-oriented business model. These services will address the needs present during the active life of datacenters and enforce growth of datacenter industry and associated industries across the EU. An example of this approach is the remote monitoring of the datacenter infrastructure using the intuitive / immersive interface of IDEAS. It will provide an innovative and competitive answer at a time when the number of datacenters is dramatically increasing in Europe due to colocation, “cloudification” of enterprise IT, but also new trends such as IoT, 5G that will result in the surge of very small and scattered datacenters (also known as Edge IT).\\nThe proposed project is needed to unlock the significant potential of commercialization of R&D results (novel datacenter monitoring software) developed in the ongoing FET project MANGO. It will use this newly developed know-how and existing 3D engines to bring this system not only to a limited research world but also to a large number of datacenter operators.',\n",

       " 'Trafisense is a monitoring service for dry-type distribution and power transformers based on proprietary machine-learning technology. Currently only 5% of dry-type power transformers are monitored beyond a very basic set of properties. As a result, owners cannot predict the state of the transformers accurately and face hardware failures and downtime. Even worse, the lack of monitoring prevents identifying the original cause of failure. The last 4 years several hundred datacenters where shut down due to dry transformer failures. 50% of failures and 60% of downtime per year in wind farms correspond to electrical component failures and transformer failures are amongst the most common sources. Additional issues arise in offshore sites due to advanced monitoring requirements. Trafisense offers a combined hardware/software solution for continuous real-time monitoring of dry-type power transformers. We process data feeds from more than 10 electrical and environmental properties to identify the risk status of the hardware and notify the customer of exceptional conditions several days or weeks before they manifest. Trafisense does not just display statistics leaving the deciphering job to the customer. Our service generates detailed actionable insights leading maintenance engineers to the root problem and suggesting specific maintenance actions. In addition to the daily and weekly automated reports, our customers receive semiannual summary reports for each monitored transformer by a team of in-house experts. Initial comparison with standard maintenance practices indicates considerable savings in maintenance cost mainly in offshore installations and onshore remote or critical installations. The reduction of false negatives results to less downtime that translates to fewer disruptions in production. Our proprietary technology generates early warnings regarding high-risk hardware states and it can reduce accidents by 80%.',\n",

       " 'The objective of this research project is to enhance business process (BP) model comprehension in European organisations through dynamic process invigoration. Analysis and improvement of BPs are key to organisations’ cost efficiency and competitiveness. A growing number of organisations in Europe implement BP management solutions to analyse and automate their processes. BP models are invaluable to define, control, improve and communicate BPs. BP models abstract a dynamic phenomenon in the form of a static representation, thus they are often difficult to comprehend. In this research, I aim at redefining the BP model comprehension problem and developing innovative solutions through a synergetic usage of process modeling and multimedia disciplines. In this way, models will be dynamically invigorated and presented to business professionals in a comprehensible manner. To fulfil the overall objective, related literature will be reviewed; BP model invigoration techniques will be designed for eight different embellishment components; the techniques will be evaluated through industrial experiments and field studies; an open source BP model invigoration tool will be developed; and results will be disseminated in European academy and industry. Eventually, organisations from various domains in Europe can utilize their BP models in a better way by using the freely available PRIME tool to invigorate their processes. This will create an opportunity to increase organisational efficiency throughout Europe. This project will contribute to my career development in many ways. I will obtain regular training on scientific and transferable skills through interdisciplinary trainings with my supervisor and other scholars, courses in research schools, and the preparation of publications. Collaboration and networking will be enhanced through joint studies with scholars and industry, enabled by the supervisor’s previous collaborations as well as my experiences.',\n",

As workstation applications become more complex and resource demanding, their data files become even larger. This data transfer to and from the cloud is time consuming and impacts an organisations security data availability policies and risks the value of the data.\\n\\nState-of-the-art: All the current virtual workstation solutions, are either public or private shared cloud solutions, meaning that they are also in a public cloud, with multi-tenant pooling of resources among multiple customers, increasing issues of data privacy and security. In addition, cloud-based solutions often require dedicated resources creating islands of technology that become cumbersome and costly to maintain and support. Most virtual workstation solutions do not manage the set-up, user resource pool usage or provide support services when the workstation is not performing, meaning users experience periods of high latency, poor performance and difficulty accessing resources.\\n\\nOur solution: ebb3 offers customers a fully managed, private cloud dedicated common GPU accelerated computing environment (CGACE) that uses an AI resource management tool for effective resource utilisation, allowing no feeling of latency for the user and freeing up resources in the datacentre for VR, ML and high performance applications.',\n",

       " 'Actual implementation of impactful applications for microfluidic devices in a commercial setting has been surprisingly limited so far. The cause can be to a great extent attributed to the main feature of microfluidic devices: their small dimensions. While miniaturized structures are essential in generating key functionalities, they are also ideal nucleation and anchor sites for solid material present in the liquid that flows through the channels, a phenomenon called fouling. This subsequently results in a reduced or loss of functionality and eventually plugging of the entire flow system. The solution to avoiding fouling is measuring the flow in microfluidic devices in 3D, by particle image velocimetry (PIV), either when designing or using them. However, achieving 3D imaging of flows is currently an extremely difficult task due to the amount of work, high costs and lengthy timelines required. Our value proposition in the ERC Proof of Concept project ‘3D-PIV’ is a table-top device able to efficiently analyse the velocimetry of particles in 3D, offering an unprecedented level of detail of the fluid motion through micron-sized channels/inlets/outlets, opening new possibilities in microfluidics design and validation with significant impact on multiple applications.  One of the killer applications we envision, and our focus in this ERC Proof of Concept project, is in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, for the manufacturing of drugs or chemical components, to enable, adjust or improve their separation. In this project we will focus on building a strong business case for our 3D-PIV technology through prototyping, optimizing software, market analysis and business development.',\n",
       " 'CD8\\\\ T cells have a key role in eliminating intracellular pathogens and tumors that affect the liver. The protective capacity of these cells relies on their ability to migrate to and traffic within the liver, recognize pathogen- or tumor-derived antigens, get activated and deploy effector functions. While some of the rules that characterize CD8\\\\ T cell behavior in the infected and cancerous liver have been characterized at the population level, we have only limited knowledge of the precise dynamics of intrahepatic CD8\\\\ T cell conduct at the single-cell level. In preliminary data for this project we have developed several advanced imaging techniques that allow us to dissect the interactive behavior of CD8\\\\ T cells within the mouse liver at an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal resolution. We predict that this approach, combined with unique models of hepatitis B virus pathogenesis and a new model of hepatocellular carcinoma created ad hoc for this proposal, will generate novel mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal determinants that govern the capacity of CD8\\\\ T cells to home and function in the virus- or tumor-bearing liver.

       " \"'Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are distributed worldwide and cause a significant percentage of all common colds. Most of these viruses presumably emerged through zoonotic transmission, have adapted to the human host, and are now known to cause mild upper respiratory tract infections. However, the more recent zoonotic transmission of the highly pathogenic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have demonstrated the potential of coronaviruses to also cause highly severe human diseases and are associated with a high mortality. The precise mechanisms that allow coronaviruses to jump across species barriers are only poorly understood. 'COV RESTRIC' aims to unravel species barriers of coronavirus infections and to uncover basic host cell mechanisms preventing a transmission across different species. We hypothesize that conserved restriction factors exist between different species which limit viral replication and which need to be overcome via viral evasion and adaptation strategies in order to establish a zoonotic infection. These may include the lack or genetic incompatibility of essential viral replication co-factors as well as the presence of antiviral restriction mechanisms. We will use two complementary genetic screening approaches to identify unknown coronavirus restriction factors. Once we have identified possible candidates, we will analyze them for their cross-conservation employing coronaviruses from different species, such as human, bat and camel virus isolates, as well as the respective primary cell culture material originating from the authentic host. This approach will help to rigorously define species barriers to viral transmission which should promote future development of preventive and therapeutic strategies to combat emerging RNA virus infections in humans.'\",\n",

       " 'To build interfaces between the electronic domain and the human nervous system is one of the most demanding challenges of nowadays engineering. Fascinating developments have already been performed such as visual cortical implants for the blind and cochlear implants for the deaf. Yet implantation of most electrical stimulation systems requires complex surgeries which hamper their use for the development of so-called electroceuticals. More importantly, previously developed systems based on central stimulation units are not adequate for applications in which a large number of sites must be individually stimulated over large and mobile body parts, thus hindering neuroprosthetic solutions for patients suffering paralysis due to spinal cord injury or other neurological disorders. A solution to these challenges could consist in developing addressable single-channel wireless microstimulators which could be implanted with simple procedures such as injection. And, indeed, such solution was proposed and tried in the past. However, previous attempts did not achieve satisfactory success because the developed implants were stiff and too large. Further miniaturization was prevented because of the use of inductive coupling and batteries as energy sources. Here I propose to explore an innovative method for performing electrical stimulation in which the implanted microstimulators will operate as rectifiers of bursts of innocuous high frequency current supplied through skin electrodes shaped as garments. This approach has the potential to reduce the diameter of the implants to one-fifth the diameter of current microstimulators and, more significantly, to allow that most of the implants’ volume consists of materials whose density and flexibility match those of neighbouring living tissues for minimizing invasiveness. In fact, implants based on the proposed method will look like short pieces of flexible thread.',\n",

Forming these diverse body shapes requires the coordinated expression of hundreds of genes in a cell-specific manner; a monumentally complex task that is controlled by gene regulatory networks (GRNs): genes linked to each other by regulatory interactions, which modulate the gene expression in every cell of an organism. Despite their central role in determining animal form and function, it is as of yet unclear how GRNs evolve and how they are linked to the origin of morphological innovation.

       " 'Despite considerable efforts aimed at prevention and treatment, the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has increased at an alarming rate worldwide over recent decades. Given the urgent need to develop safe and efficient anti-obesity drugs, the scientific community has to intensify efforts to better understand the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. Based on human genome-wide association studies and targeted mouse mutagenesis models, it has recently emerged that the brain controls most aspects of systemic metabolism and that obesity may be a brain disease. I have recently shown that like neurons, astrocytes also respond to circulating nutrients, and they cooperate with neurons to efficiently regulate energy metabolism. So far, the study of brain circuits controlling energy balance has focused on neurons, ignoring the presence and role of astrocytes. Importantly, our studies were the first to describe that exposure to a high-fat, highsugar (HFHS) diet triggers hypothalamic astrogliosis prior to significant body weight gain, indicating a potentially important role in promoting obesity. Overall, my recent findings suggest a novel model in which astrocytes are actively involved in the central nervous system (CNS) control of metabolism, likely including active crosstalk between astrocytes and neurons. To test this hypothetical model, I propose to develop a functional understanding of astroglia-neuronal communication in the CNS control of metabolism focusing on: 1) dissecting the ability of astrocytes to release gliotransmitters to neurons, 2) assessing how astrocytes respond to neuronal activity, and 3) determining if HFHS-induced astrogliosis interrupts this crosstalk and contributes to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. These studies aim to uncover the molecular underpinnings of astrocyte-neuron inputs regulating metabolism in health and disease so as to\\ninspire and enable novel therapeutic strategies to fight diabetes and obesity.',\n",
       " 'Non-invasive observation of fast spatiotemporal activity patterns of large neural populations distributed over entire brains is a longstanding goal of neuroscience. Not only would such abilities significantly promote our knowledge on brain function and its pathophysiology but they are also expected to accelerate development of novel therapies targeting neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. The progress is hampered by the limited capacity of state-of-the-art functional neuroimaging tools, which do not permit simultaneous monitoring of whole-brain activity with an adequate spatiotemporal resolution. Our recently developed five-dimensional optoacoustic tomography technique is ideally poised to overcome these limitations – it has shown excellent capacity for imaging intrinsic contrast in entire brains of vertebrates and rodents non-invasively; delivers unmatched temporal resolution in the milliseconds range for true volumetric imaging in real time; capable of label-free observations of hemodynamic changes and sensitive to genetic markers of neural activity. \\nYet, several fundamental challenges ought to be addressed before true potential of optoacoustic functional neuroimaging is unveiled. First, optoacoustic monitoring of fast neural activation under physiologically relevant stimuli and in real disease models has not been achieved. Furthermore, a variety of acoustic effects introduced by the skull compromise performance of optoacoustics in transcranial imaging of murine models, further hindering its clinical translation potential. Finally, technology needs to be developed that can deliver information from single neurons while maintaining high volumetric imaging speed. By resolving those challenges, the current project will yield a unique and groundbreaking functional neuroimaging method that can truly transform the existing paradigms in neuroscience by delivering real time information from hundreds of thousands or even millions of neurons simultaneously.',\n",
       " 'The project outlined here addresses the fundamental question how the brain encodes and controls behavior. While we have a reasonable understanding of the role of entire brain areas in such processes, and of mechanisms at the molecular and synaptic levels, there is a big gap in our knowledge of how behavior is controlled at the level of defined neuronal circuits.\\n\\nIn natural environments, chances for survival depend on learning about possible aversive and appetitive outcomes and on the appropriate behavioral responses. Most studies addressing the underlying mechanisms at the level of neuronal circuits have focused on aversive learning, such as in Pavlovian fear conditioning. Understanding how activity in defined neuronal circuits mediates appetitive learning, as well as how these circuitries are shared and interact with aversive learning circuits, is a central question in the neuroscience of learning and memory and the focus of this grant application.\\n\\nUsing a multidisciplinary approach in mice, combining behavioral, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological, imaging, optogenetic and state-of-the-art viral circuit tracing techniques, we aim at dissecting the neuronal circuitry of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning with a focus on the amygdala, a key brain region important for both aversive and appetitive learning. Ultimately, elucidating these mechanisms at the level of defined neurons and circuits is fundamental not only for an understanding of memory processes in the brain in general, but also to inform a mechanistic approach to psychiatric conditions associated with amygdala dysfunction and dysregulated emotional responses including anxiety and mood disorders.',\n",
       " 'Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder, characterised by the inability of a person’s brain to produce a neurotransmitter called dopamine, lessening a person’s ability to regulate body motions. PD affects 10m people globally, its prevalence is expected to double by 2040. There is no cure for PD, current therapies focus on treating symptoms that undermine patients’ quality of life. Costs associated with PD are higher than its prevalence, causing substantial economic burden on individuals, families and society. In 2004, the annual spending in Europe on PD was €10.7b. As costly as they are, these therapies improve motor symptoms in the early stages of PD, but over time, patients have more and more reduced response to medications and become more disabled. Thus, they cannot be considered as ideal with regard to efficacy, long-term effectiveness and safety. NINDS (part of the US NIH) set recommendations addressing Gait as one of the 3 top priorities for advancing basic clinical research on PD. We have aligned ourselves with NINDS’ strategy through development of GondolaTM.\\nGondolaTM is a portable medical device made for people living with PD. It delivers a non-invasive neurostimulation treatment named Automated Mechanical Peripheral Stimulation (AMPS). It is based on physical neurostimulations of specific points in both feet, which allow to increase the afferent inputs from the peripheral nervous system to the spinal cord, and induce a better functioning of the central pattern generator (the mechanism that regulates movements in the body). Four clinical studies have documented that AMPS is effective in improving motor skills in PD, particularly slowness of movements and freezing of gait. Users have derived the following benefits from the device: Reduced Freezing of gait, gait hesitation, slowness of movements, improved independence, self-confidence, fluidity in walking and balance, reducing the risk of falls and improving the quality of life.',\n",
       " 'Current therapeutic options for human treponematoses, syphilis and yaws, are, broadly speaking, restricted to one antibiotic: injectable penicillin. The drug susceptibility profile of Treponema pallidum (T.p) is unknown because the microorganism could not be grown in culture. Treatment failure after penicillin has been related to syphilis bacteria that survive in the central nervous system (CNS) and the potential of strains to acquire resistance to penicillin has recently been recognized. Yaws can be treated with azithromycin but there is a real risk that macrolide-resistant strains disseminate widely and jeopardize the global eradication campaign. I propose a research program to have other validated treatment options with good CNS penetration that are efficacious for all the stages of treponemal infection. Our preliminary results using computational prediction of drug activity based on similarity to drugs with known activity against T.p. and other spirochetes shows several candidate antibiotics. I will take advantage of recent developments in culture methods for determination of drug susceptibility to test 20 prioritized drugs. These results will be confirmed in experimentally infected rabbits treated with the investigational drugs and assessed for lesion development and T.p. burden. My second approach will exploit the established expertise of my team conducting randomized clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of the 2 most promising candidates compared to standard treatment to cure patients with syphilis/yaws. Such studies will incorporate in-depth studies of recurrent events among study participants, to further clarify the biological basis and identify mutations that confer resistance to B-lactams. New antibacterial oral drugs for the treatment of treponematoses will be a tremendous resource in case of penicillin treatment-failure, resistance, shortage, allergy, or for use in yaws combination regimens to reduce the likelihood of resistance selection.',\n",
       " 'The dynamic of neural computation is often studied in individual cells using inserted electrodes, or using low-resolution methods such as EEG. Functional fluorescent imaging has recently emerged as a powerful complementary tool that allows single-cell resolution of relatively large networks, opening a new regime to neuroscience. However, complex brains are generally opaque and can only be studied with scanning two-photon microscopes; with the achievable depth limited to ~0.6mm, and the volume limited by the relatively slow scan.\\nThis project will develop ultrafast scanning multiphoton microscopes to image neural activity at cellular resolution over large volumes, and at greater depth. Using these we will study patterns of activity in the hippocampus, and particularly attempt to observe the pathways involved in memory retention. To increase speed we will use temporal focusing to controllably sculpt the excitation volume and enlarge the focal spot. This reduces the number of measured pixels and allows faster scanning (or larger volume), at the cost of resolution. This will allow 25x faster imaging in a resonant scanning two-photon microscope; allowing observation of many thousands of cells at once, which could reveal the wide-scale characteristic activity.\\nWe will build a second microscope that uses three-photon excitation with temporal focusing. Three-photon imaging relies on longer wavelengths that penetrate deeper into tissue, and also suppresses background fluorescence which could otherwise limit depth. Consequently, this microscope will allow high-speed imaging at depth exceeding 1mm. This allows study of information transfer across multiple layers; or provides access to the hippocampus through the intact cortex. These studies could provide crucial insights to neuroscience that are currently accessible only for a few neurons.\\nFollowing completion of this project these microscopes could have an enduring impact as they continue to be used to study neural dynamics.',\n",

       " 'Problem\\nThe integration of more renewable energy into the grid, creating highly variable, unpredictable and distributed energy production, uneven load and peak demand and transmission losses create significant challenges for utilities to effectively guarantee energy supply. \\nDespite the investing billions of euros in Smart Meters, it is clear they are not the solution. They only collect limited amounts of data for the utility, do not give households greater control of their energy use, and cannot implement demand side management. \\n\\nSolution – Bl!xt DigiBreaker\\nDigiBreaker turns your fuse box into a smartphone, collecting and communicating rich, real time electricity usage data as it passes through the circuit breaker. All the time while maintaining the core function of a circuit breaker, which is to interrupt current flow when there is a fault in the system. DigiBreaker breaks 1000 times faster and is more secure than the mechanical devices.\\nDigiBreaker offers the following functionality:\\n•\\tEnables remote demand side management for the utility.\\n•\\tDirect two-way communication between the utility and the household.\\n•\\tAn integrated controller that measures and collects detailed energy usage. \\n•\\tCan be controlled remotely via smart phone or computer. \\n\\nProject\\nThe aim of the phase 1 project is to improve our understanding of the value DigiBreaker holds for our target customer and clearly map out the route to market. In phase 2 we envisage to scale up the technology, establish a strategy for compliance in Europe, run pilots with utilities and build a commercial and operational strategic plan to demonstrate these aspects to utilities on a large scale. \\n\\nImpact & Market\\nWe estimate that DigiBreakers could replace traditional circuit breakers and fuses, which will have an estimated market size of over 27 billion € by 2020. Reaching 5% of this market by 2025 would provide us with returns of over 60M€ and an IRR of 81%.',\n",
       " 'One of the key technologies to enable efficient Ultra-High By-Pass ratio geared turbofans is the low-pressure turbine (LPT). While the geared engine architecture allows a large reduction in LPT stage count and weight, the LPT operates at transonic exit Mach numbers and low-Reynolds numbers. Within this range of operating conditions, there is a critical shortage of aerodynamic and performance measurements. A lack of relevant experimental data in these engine-like conditions also concerns the interaction of the secondary-air and leakage flows with the mainstream. SPLEEN aims at filling up this gap with an extensive experimental undertaking that investigates the aerodynamics of high-speed LP turbines of geared-fan propulsion systems. The project focuses on the interaction of cavity purge and leakage flows with the mainstream and its impact on the turbine performance. SPLEEN addresses this challenge with detailed flow measurements in two world-class turbine rigs: a large scale, transonic, low-Reynolds number linear cascade including periodic incoming wakes, and a high-speed 1.5 stage turbine rig. The project first investigates the effect of cavity geometries and purge flow rates on the local flow features and turbine performance in the linear cascade. A new technology for the reduction of leakage-induced losses will be proposed, designed and tested in the cascade facility. In the second part of SPLEEN, a 1.5 LP turbine stage is tested at scale 1 in the rotating rig. The flow structures, turbine global performance and the unsteady leakage/purge flow interactions are measured at fully representative engine conditions. Turbine experiments are carried out at different operating conditions for two sets of hub and shroud cavity configurations. The SPLEEN project will validate new high-speed LPT technologies in engine-relevant environments (TRL up to 5) delivering new critical knowledge and unique experimental databases of major importance for turbomachinery designs.',\n",

Indeed, previous studies have shown that Smart Meters do not lead to energy savings in the residential sector unless households actively use them and are encouraged to modify their everyday practices. Our project intends to fill in this gap, while also raising awareness on demand response services. \\nThe way we intend to do so is by developing a training program for installers, social workers and other frontline staff in contact with vulnerable people, so that they can inform vulnerable consumers about the benefits brought about by smart metering and advise them on how to use their Smart Meter and In Home Display (IHD) units (where fitted) to best effect, each time they are in contact with them. Indeed, most vulnerable and low-income householders require a one-to-one and on-going support. \\nThe training packages will be tested and improved before getting disseminated towards the major actors involved in smart meters deployment (DSOs, energy utilities, installers…). From 50 to 100 installers or other frontline staff will be trained in each project partner’s country. Each of them will deliver face-to-face advise to 10 to 20 households, so as to reach 1,000 households in each country. DSO and energy utilities (depending on the national context) will be involved to provide the necessary support for this experiment and to ensure further dissemination of the training packages.\\nBesides empowering vulnerable consumers, the project will serve to get some feedback on their specific needs and on the ways to appropriately communicate with them and help them take profit of smart metering. The project will also help consolidate data on how much energy can be saved if vulnerable householders are empowered to make best use of the opportunities that Smart Metering offers.',\n",

The phenomenology concerns low-energy states of a nucleus under study and transitions between them. The project consists of two parts. Part I will provide theoretical descriptions of experimental data, chiefly taken in GANIL with Radioactive-Ion Beams, related with shape coexistence (objective GN1), pear-shaped nuclei (GN2) and shape/ phase transitions (GN3). The theoretical models to be used are the Geometric Collective Model (GCM) and the Shell Model (SM). Part II will introduce conformal symmetry in nuclear structure as a means to explain the occurrence of nuclear shapes.\\nIt will be introduced in the SM (GN4) to investigate the emergence of the GCM from complex many-body calculations. This will be achieved by extending the SU(3) model of quadrupole deformation and a related description of octupole deformation through algebraic methods used in classical Yang-Mills theories. Conformal symmetry will also be introduced in the GCM (GN5) as a means to import higher symmetries in the GCM and investigate their relation with single-particle effects. This will be achieved based on a geometric method using formal correspondences with cosmological models, recently explored by the candidate. These correspondences will be extended to methods used in the gravitational multipole moments with the aim to propose the conformal symmetry of space as a fundamental symmetry of the nuclear multipole moments. In parallel, patterns of conformal symmetry in nuclear structure will be investigated numerically within the Interacting Boson Model. The theoretical results of Part II will be examined in shape coexistence, pear shaped nuclei and shape/phase transitions.\\nDuring this entire project precious transfer of knowledge will occur between the candidate, the supervisor and the experimental groups in GANIL.',\n",
       " \"Geometry studies higher-dimensional curved spaces. We can describe these spaces by equations, but the only case where we have any hope to use them for calculation is when the equations are polynomials. The resulting spaces are the objects of algebraic geometry, which are called varieties. Although these objects have been studied for a long time, there are still lots of crucial open problems: If we are given a variety, can we embed it in other well-known varieties? For instance, can we find a 'nice' surface which contains a given curve? If yes, how many such surfaces exist, and can we characterise them via some of the geometrical properties of the curve?   \\n\\t\\n  The geometric information of varieties can be encoded in algebraic objects, known as derived categories. Inspired by ideas in string theory, Bridgeland introduced the notion of stability conditions on derived categories. This topic has been highly studied due to its connections to various fields in mathematics and physics, and lots of ideas and techniques have been developed in the area.     \\n    \\n   Now is the time to employ the whole spectrum of modern tools in derived categories and stability conditions to solve so far intractable geometrical problems. My recent work proves that deformation of stability conditions and varying stability status of an object (wall-crossing phenomenon) are powerful new techniques for solving long-standing geometrical problems, that do not appear to involve derived categories. Surprisingly, stability conditions and wall-crossing truly provide the right context for studying those problems.\\n   \\n    \\n  The main goal of this research programme is to draw upon ideas and tools in algebra, geometry and mathematical physics to describe some outstanding geometrical problems in terms of derived categories and stability conditions, and then apply wall-crossing techniques to solve those problems.\",\n",

Space based electronic components are produced in a different way, and much more expensive, than the ones built for use on our planet. To make situation even worse, the processing power of radiation hardened microprocessors is much worse, than what we normally expect from the CPU. Long distances, that space brings and radiation also diminish the possible communication rate, while radiation problems with storage devices complicates even storing the filmed material for later compression and transmission. Because of all these problems, humanity was never even close to be able to establish a decent video link with some other celestial object. To overcome this problem, we developed a different type of picture and video compression method.\\n\\nASC compression is a lossy type of compression, that differs from other types of lossy compression because it removes the main amount of data before any complex mathematical functions are executed. Other types of compression perform a complex transform first and remove the less important data later. This makes standard compression types much more resource hungry, than the ASC compression.\\n\\nUnlike jpeg and mpeg compression, where compression is done in squares, that are always positioned at the same positions of the picture, ASC method builds the picture around the most prominent points of it. This helps the encoder to easily find similar patterns in different pictures or parts of one picture but also removes the block appearance at high levels of compression. At high levels of compression, the picture simply looses more and more details. Testing so far has proven the truth of our expectation, that the quality of the picture doesn't deteriorate fast with increasing compression.\",\n",

       " 'The color gamut of a display is the set of colors that it can reproduce: screens with wider gamuts are capable of presenting more vivid, intense colors. Different display technologies have different gamuts, from the narrow gamut of TV sets to the wide gamut of cinema and the ultra-wide gamut of laser projectors. Gamut mapping is the process of adapting the colors of an image to the gamut of the display where it is shown, and it is an essential process at every step of the imaging chain: cameras perform automatic gamut reduction, in movie postproduction colorists perform gamut mapping manually, and emerging display technologies perform automatic gamut extension. There is a trade-off between speed and quality, and no method, be it automatic or manual, is exempt from issues. One of the research outcomes of the applicant’s ERC Starting Grant IP4EC is a vision-based gamut mapping method that is automatic, of extremely low computational complexity, and produces images and videos that look natural, without any halos, spurious colors or artifacts. The model has been validated confirming that it outperforms state of the art algorithms in terms of users’ preference. A European patent application has been filed.

But also the language of social networking is based on images and videos. Both formats growing faster than the text. The algorithms are far from understanding the meaning of multimedia contents, or extract useful information from them. Our solution assumes that today, and for a long time, this work can only be done by the human mind. Therefore we have the technology and methodology appropriate to do so. The analysis is performed by distributing micro-tasks to the mobile devices of a community of human solvers. The specific software creates micro-tasks, distributes it and reports the results. The micro-tasks are presented as games or activities that are resolved in less than 1 minute. The solvers are anonymous volunteers who perform the micro-tasks in exchange for an amount of money that is donated to the NGO of their choice. To participate, the solvers must download an application on their mobile devices. Virtually any business is a potential client of this solution, but especially those with brands targeted directly to consumers, with great presence in social networks. The scope of our project is first European and then global. The software and methodology have already been tested successfully in image analysis projects conducted by The Harvard University and the University of Barcelona. However, before marketing it is necessary to work on the value proposition meeting the information needs of businesses and testing the solution in a business environment. We also need to study the motivations of solvers to develop plans for growth of this community. Moreover the BP must be completed. These are objectives of Phase 1',\n",
       " 'Despite the huge amount of electrical energy needed to move a ropeway up to a mountain, higher as faster it turns, all around the globe they keep turning at the same nominal speed regardless how many people are waiting for boarding. It would be obvious to adjust the frequency of pass of gondolas, chair lifts or ropeways in general to the number of users that are waiting. In a ski resort, that number uses to be low most of time, workdays. Therefore, a system able to automatically know how long people must wait and able to modify the ropeway speed according to it, could noticeably reduce the energy consumption and would offer a better service during the rush hour.\\nRopeways have the possibility of manually modifying their speed already, a task that can be performed by the driver. Nevertheless, regarding the experience of ski resorts managers, it is more critical asking him/her to take care of the boarding manoeuvres of users than optimizing the ropeway speed, hence that last uses to turn at its nominal speed.\\nBlue Snow is an integrated system that:\\n1. Determines the queue waiting-time in the boarding area of a ropeway and informs about it to users and facility managers. This part has been pilot-tested.\\n2.

       " 'Video content uploaded on social video sharing systems such as YouTube, Vimeo, or Dailymotion has experienced an exponential growth in the past years, making them the favorite medium for advertisement. The ease of sharing and accessing video content has also provoked significant efforts on the side of content creators and owners aimed at protecting their video assets from illegal reproduction and distribution, including the distribution through different channels, the use of digital right management (DRM) encrypted systems, and video fingerprinting systems for the detection of illegally uploaded video content.\\n\\nThe ambition of VideoPlus is to develop a close-to-market system that would serve as a “uniform resource identifier” for video content, employing technologies which are based on video fingerprinting to precisely synchronize spatio-temporal metadata with any video content, without being limited to any specific video source or distribution channel. VideoPlus builds on three main components: (i) the algorithmic core is the result of the ERC-funded project COMET, where we developed an efficient fingerprinting algorithm capable of extracting a short binary signature (hash) of image and video content and instantaneously locate it in a very large dataset; (ii) the back-end would employ specifically tailored data structures to store and retrieve spatio-temporal information (e.g. video subtitles and annotations) together with frame hashes and align it with the video; (iii) the front-end would capture the video content, extract its hash, communicate with the back-end to retrieve the spatio-temporal metadata, display them synchronously with the video, and allow user interaction. In particular, we will develop front-ends for two platforms: an Android mobile device (smartphone or tablet), allowing to playback local or remote videos or capture video content through the mobile device camera, and Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality glasses.',\n",

As different institutions and actors increasingly turn to fiction film to circulate messages about borders, the study looks at how borders and fiction film have been related since the early 20th century. Border regimes are intimately intertwined with cultural imaginations and representations of borders and their insiders and outsiders. This project is the first to comprehensively investigate this relation across different borderlands and for the various actors involved. While grounded in the cultural studies tradition, it originally combines insights from representations research, film theory, popular geopolitics, border studies and migration studies.\\nThe main questions to be addressed are: What are the cultural imaginations of borders and its insiders and outsiders found in fiction film? How do different societal actors use fiction film to construct, contest, or experience territorial borders? These questions will be answered by looking at 3 groups of actors (institutions, creatives, and borderlanders) at 3 borderland cases: Ireland-UK, Turkey-Syria, and the Ceuta and Melilla exclaves. The study will combine archival work with media studies methods (production, content and reception analysis) and participatory filmmaking where borderlanders will make their own short films. \\nREEL BORDERS will have a threefold impact. Empirically, it puts film firmly on the map of research on borders, conflict and migration, while expanding the horizon both in terms of historical depth and geographical width. Methodologically, it will include the most ambitious participatory film study to date. Theoretically, the study will establish new conceptual understandings of borders and belonging in cultural studies and beyond.',\n",

Two groups of ques-tions are connected to this study perspective, which will be answered by means of a democratic-theoretically-led synchronous comparison of selected contemporary protest movements – anonymous digi-tal protest movements, transnationally organized alter-globalization protest movements, the No Border movement and the rightwing identitarian protest movement: The aim is to clarify firstly (1) the extent to which the new forms of protest question the premises of democratic orders, what potential for further de-velopment lies within the new forms of protest on the one hand, and what are the challenges to democracy on the other. Secondly, the aim is to determine (2) the influence and relevance held by the democratic order itself in an age of the changing shape of democracy with regard to the specific formation of the new forms of protest, and what statements can be made on how the formation of the order is changed, in turn, by the new forms of protest themselves. In order to achieve these study perspectives, POWDER consists of an overarching democratic-theoretical framework project (TFP) and four empirical subprojects (SP 1-4), which each analyze one of the protest movements mentioned in the context of a qualitative approach (documentary analysis, participatory observation, qualitative interviews). The comparison of these protest movements investigates (I) recurring patterns, but also contrasting assessments with regard to the interre-lationship between the political order and the protest movements, examines at a second level (II) the dif-ferent manners in which the new forms of protest challenge democratic-theoretical dimensions, and at-tempts at the third level (III) to reconstruct a general democratic-theoretical determination of meaning of present-day protest movements.',\n",

Although “world cinema” and “transnational cinema” scholars have attempted to broaden its canon and frameworks, several major problems persist. Films and scholarship by Africans in particular, and by people of colour in general, are frequently marginalised if not altogether excluded. This prevents exciting exchanges that could help to re-envision Film and Screen Studies for the twenty-first century, in an era in which greater access to the technological means of making films, and circulating them on a range of screens, means that dynamic “screen worlds” are developing at a rapid rate. AFRISCREENWORLDS will study these “screen worlds” (in both their textual forms and industrial structures), with a focus on Africa, as a way of centring the most marginalised regional cinema. We will also elaborate comparative studies of global “screen worlds” – and, in particular, “screen worlds” in the Global South – exploring their similarities, differences, and parallel developments. We will respond to the exclusions of Film and Screen Studies not only in scholarly ways – through conferences and publications – but also in creative and activist ways – through drawing on cutting-edge creative research methodologies (such as audiovisual criticism and filmmaking) and through helping to decolonise Film and Screen Studies (through the production of ‘toolkits’ on how to make curricula, syllabi, and teaching more globally representative and inclusive). On a theoretical level, we will make an intervention through considering how the concept of “screen worlds” is better equipped than “world cinema” or “transnational cinema” to explore the complexities of audiovisual narratives, and their production and circulation in our contemporary moment, in diverse contexts throughout the globe.',\n",

However, there is a growing activity in the so-called music synchronization business: music composed, retrieved, or otherwise produced to fit with the many constraints of videos, movies, games or commercials. Synchronized music has to satisfy complex constraints, specified temporally (specific events at specific moments, or, in the case of interactive music, specific moods matching the player’s situation, etc.). Major movie, game and advertisement companies devote considerable budgets to get synchronized music by famous artists. Producing such synchronized music is a costly process currently performed manually by well-known artists or specialized studios. This results in prohibitive costs for high-quality synchronized music, that only a few professional customers can afford.\\nThe commercial value of synchronized music lies in the style of the composer. Style is what makes an artist’s music easily recognizable: Paul McCartney has a unique composition style, Joao Gilberto has a distinctive guitar accompaniment style, and Take 6 are well known for their incomparable harmonization style. Producing operational representations of style is precisely the subject matter of the ERC project Flow-machines, which already produced scientific and technical breakthroughs: turning style into a new content type is within reach. The next step is to explore commercial strategies to exploit style. \\nThe goal of this PoC project is to apply these techniques to synchronized music, and to study three business models in the movie, game and advertisement sectors. The project will: 1) develop a style manipulation prototype for synchronized music, 2) evaluate the prototype in the key industrial sectors and 3) clear legal issues related to the exploitation of style information.',\n",

       " 'Emotions shape our personal lives and society at large. In Europe emotional disorders affect one in five people; it is the most chronic and second to most disabling health condition. The stakes to better understand our emotional behaviour are high; however there is still a lot to gain. Traditionally, emotions are thought to guide our behaviour either through fast instincts or deliberately selected actions. Current explanations of emotional health and disease frequently focus on one of these single components in isolation (or regard them as exclusive antagonists), but likely underestimate our emotional behaviour’s complexity and diversity.\\nHere I will investigate a complementary account: I suggest that in humans optimal emotional behaviour arises not from these instinctual and deliberate action selection systems individually, but from their interaction, mediated in our brain by a likely uniquely human prefrontal control system. First, using an innovative task, behavioural profiling, and formal computational modelling I will determine the influence and interaction of these systems in emotional behaviour. Second, I will use concurrent neuroimaging (fMRI) and neurostimulation (tDCS), geared at the prefrontal control system and its connectivity with amygdala and parietal cortex, to investigate their causal mechanisms during emotional situations.\\nThis ambitious project combines my extensive experience in emotional behaviour with the world-leading expertise of University College London in computational neuroimaging and neurostimulation. These investigations are deliberately designed to both further our understanding of emotional behaviour and to initiate a path for improved treatment of emotional disorders in Europe. The computational modelling approach will elucidate hidden mechanisms and promote personalized diagnosis, while the modulatory neurostimulation approach will provide new avenues for targeted treatment ready to be developed in collaboration with the clinic.',\n",

       " 'From the 1960s to the 1980s, numerous younger European composers were drawn to theatrical projects that overturned the established conventions of the opera house. These projects were typically small in scale and experimented with new relationships between instrumental performance and staged action. This ‘New Music Theatre’ is today regarded as an important manifestation of the experimental spirit of the time, and remains widely influential upon present-day creative production. However, histories of the genre have been misleading in focusing almost exclusively upon the figure of the composer. Documentary evidence shows clearly that new music theatre typically emerged from collaborations between composers, writers, directors, and performers, who dynamically mediated practices and theories from different disciplines and backgrounds. For instance, singer Roy Hart inspired works by Stockhausen and Henze, Eugenio Barba’s and Berio’s contemporaneous views about voice were liminal, while Peter Brook’s dramaturgy was supported by the work of lesser known composers and practitioners. NePraMusT aims to retrace some of those interactions, voicing the role of numerous creative agents currently underrepresented in official accounts. Through gathering extensive documentary evidence from European archives and undertaking practice-led investigation of historical actor training and voice work, the action will establish how music and theatre converged in these projects, throwing light on the creative and aesthetic crosscurrents that have heavily shaped present-day creative practices. NePraMusT will contribute to enhance the ER’s skills and future employability prospects, opening new training opportunities both as an academic and an artist-researcher, furthering her ability to plan, organise, develop her dissemination and public outreach competencies, and reinforcing her professional networks of practitioners and researchers versed in theatre and music theatre studies.',\n",
       " 'A common feature of neurodegenerative diseases, including highly prevalent illnesses, is the presence of misfolded protein aggregates in affected regions of the nervous system. Aggregates result from the misfolding of one or more specific proteins, for example, amyloid-β in Alzheimer’s disease, α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease, and the normal prion protein in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Recently a series of exciting studies has suggested a prion-like mechanism underlying the pathological spreading of misfolded proteins (mainly tau, α-synuclein and huntingtin) involved in various neurodegenerative diseases. Particularly striking is the recovery of α-synuclein aggregates from engrafted embryonic neurons in post-mortem brains transplanted from Parkinson’s patients. Thus, while questioning the therapeutic use of transplants, the understanding of the molecular and cellular fundaments of cell-to-cell transmission of proteinaceous aggregates is clearly in the early stages of investigation and may represent a more readily accessible target for novel disease-modifying therapies, allowing the development of possible common therapeutic strategies. \\nTunneling nanotubes (TNTs) represent a novel mechanism of direct intercellular communication that has been shown to mediate both transfer of prions between neuronal cells and the passage of poliQ huntingtin between neurons. We hypothesize that TNT-mediated transfer of amyloidogenic protein aggregates represents one of the main pathways of communication between cells. Thus, molecules involved in TNT formation could represent valuable targets for the disease prevention. Here I will assess the underlying mechanism of cell-to cell transfer of α-synuclein, exploring whether its transport could be mediated by TNTs in physiologically relevant in vitro models, evaluating as well the possible contribution of non-cell autonomous processes, via neuron-glial interactions, to the pathological spreading of the protein.',\n",
       " 'Lower limb amputations are consequence of trauma, cancer, congenital or diabetes complications, and vascular diseases. Although currently available prostheses are becoming increasingly sophisticated, these solutions still lack of sensory feedback and therefore prevent correct generation of postural reflexes at the spinal level of the amputee. Amputees, not having sensory feedback from their prosthesis, do not feel trampled obstacles, slopes or holes, risking continuously falling. They report phantom pain from the missing extremity and do not feel the prosthesis as part of their body (low embodiment). All these factors cause abandonment of the prosthesis or reduced engagement in activities of daily leaving. SENSY is a unique product, which allows amputees to feel again their missing limbs by restoring a complete motor-sensor ability that enables their natural walking (and standing) capability. The device is composed of implantable transversal multi- and intra- fascicular neural electrodes, an implantable neurostimulator, an external controller and a sensorized sole (artificial skin). The neurostimulator is implanted in the limb and is wired to the intraneural electrodes that are inserted transversally into the peripheral leg nerves. Stimulation of sensory nerves is driven wirelessly by an external controller, which transforms the readout of the sensors embedded in the sensorized sole into stimulation parameters. The sensorized sole is adaptable to the prostheses currently available in the market (e.g., Rheo Knee, C-Leg). SENSY is the only neuro-prosthetic device that restores amputee’s sensory feedback from his/her missing limb and meets all major needs associated with the use of existing artificial legs: regain natural walking, avoid falls, perceive the prosthesis as part of the body, and treat phantom limb pain.',\n",
       " 'Humans are very social animals who are able to understand the consequences of their actions on others. Therefore, why is it that some individuals are more likely to choose actions that have negative consequences for others? This project will explore this important question by using an original and innovative approach focusing on the subjective experience of agency and responsibility of individuals when they select a moral or an immoral action, together with their empathic response at the moment of the act. The general aim of the present research project is to refine our understanding of the mechanisms driving both responsibility and empathy and to generate a model that integrates these two aspects to better understand what guides moral behaviours in coercive situations. To achieve this aim, we will use psychophysiology and fMRI techniques to understand how the neural circuits associated with the sense of agency and empathy interact through different experimental paradigms.

       " 'Detecting surprising events, such as the sudden approach of a predator or an unexpected touch, is crucial for the survival of all species. We aim to study neuronal mechanisms underlying surprising events. In order to predict upcoming events, mental models of future actions are essential. Where in the brain are such predictions and mental models created? The somatosensory cortex might contain a body model, in which superficial layers provide context and sensory memories, and inputs from deeper layers allow for simulating body movements. In rats, the somatosensory cortex is activated by tickling, which is a special form of unexpected touch containing elements of both sensory and social surprise. However, self-touch induces signals which prevent activation of the somatosensory cortex and prevent self-tickle. Where do these self-touch induced inhibitory signals come from? We hypothesize that the cerebellum is the source of self-touch induced signals. The cerebellum has reciprocal connections with key forebrain areas, including the somatosensory cortex. Combined with its known role in adapting action to sensory and internally generated events, the cerebellum seems well placed to aid in the processing of surprising events. We will test in mice and rats the hypothesis that the cerebellum plays a key role in processing unexpected events to modulate representations in somatosensory cortex. By combining the applicant’s experience in recordings from awake behaving mice, the expertise of the lab of Prof. Wang at Princeton University in cerebellar research with a focus on motor and non-motor function, and the expertise of the lab of Prof. Brecht at Humboldt-Universitaet in naturalistic systems neuroscience, we are well placed to study the cerebellar signals for sensory prediction. This study can help us to understand how we make sense of the complex environment around us by combining different inputs to form predictions and signal unexpected events during surprising situations.',\n",
       " 'It is essential for survival across the animal kingdom to make appropriate choices depending on the environmental context and the internal state. Nevertheless, how decision-making is implemented in the nervous system by specific circuits remains a significant gap in our knowledge. Many actions are physically mutually exclusive so competitive interactions must exist to enable the selection of one behavior and concomitant full suppression of all alternatives. Often, behaviors are not single actions but multiple actions organized into sequences that allow the animals to achieve their goals and mechanisms must be in place to regulate the transition between the behaviors in a sequence. Here again the network architecture underlying the generation of action sequences is not known with synaptic resolution. The difficulty in determining the detailed network architectures underlying decision-making and sequence generation is primarily due to the challenges in mapping connectivity between neurons with synaptic resolution and establishing causality between neurons and behaviors with cellular resolution with the model systems used. We propose to study circuit mechanisms of selection, repression and transitions between actions and fill the above described knowledge gap. Our multidisciplinary approach will combine neural manipulation during behavior, electron microscopy (EM) reconstruction of neuronal connectivity with synaptic resolution in the tractable model system, the Drosophila larva with modeling and quantitative behavioral analysis. We aim at determining with unprecedented resolution the network architectures and circuit mechanisms underlying competitive interactions and sequence transitions. Determining basic principles of behavioral choice and sequence implementation in the tractable genetic model system will lay the basis for future investigations in larger, more complex systems.',\n",
       " 'Animals have adapted to their ecological niche by developing unique behavioral strategies. However, little is known about the underlying changes in neuronal circuit structure and/or function. To understand how evolution might modify nervous systems, I propose to perform comparative neurobiological analyses of the anatomy and physiology of central olfactory circuitry in two drosophilid species (Drosophila sechellia and D. melanogaster), which have adapted to different niches and display distinct odor-evoked behaviors. Although several changes in peripheral, sensory neuron properties have been observed between these species, the function and evolution of central circuitry has not yet been examined. The architecture and the neuronal coding properties of the primary olfactory center (antennal lobe; AL) of D. melanogaster is well-characterized and thus serves as an excellent “reference” for interspecies comparison. Using new neurogenetic approaches in D. sechellia, I will first use calcium imaging to record physiological responses in the AL to volatile cues evoking short- and long-range attraction behavior. Second, I will trace the projections of second-order olfactory neurons to higher brain centers using genetically-encoded photoactivable markers and/or trans-synaptic tracers. Third, I will study the structure and function of these central pathways in odor-evoked attraction by combining trans-synaptic labeling and optogenetics. Together, these experiments will help us understand how different olfactory pathways mediate long and short range attraction and how they are modified during evolution to confer species-specific behavioral outputs.',\n",
       " 'Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects 1% of elderly persons and is currently incurable. PD pathogenesis is driven, at least in part, by defects in proteostasis and mitochondrial function, leading to degeneration of dopaminergic axons and neuronal death. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) such as GDNF can protect and restore dopaminergic axons. However, attempts to deploy NTFs ectopically in therapy models, or to increase proteostasis and mitochondrial function, have met with only limited success.\\nI hypothesize that instead of ectopic application, over-expression of relevant pathways restricted to physiologically appropriate cells provides a potent therapeutic approach to treat PD. I have made significant progress toward this goal by targeting the 3’UTR in the mouse Gdnf gene, thereby increasing expression levels without affecting the gene’s spatiotemporal expression pattern. Using this approach I have shown that elevation of endogenous GDNF levels protects mice from experimentally induced PD. Unlike ectopic GDNF application, it causes no side effects. Importantly, I have established that GDNF levels can be elevated by 3’UTR targeting in adulthood, suggesting that this strategy could be applied in humans late in life.\\n I will use 3’UTR targeting to study the therapeutic potential of overexpressing endogenous genes, using transgenics and CRISPR-Cas9‒mediated 3’UTR editing in adult mice. First, I will increase the expression of NTFs in adult mice with experimentally induced PD. Next, I will upregulate genes important in mitochondrial function and proteostasis and test whether concurrently upregulating endogenous NTFs is a viable approach for treating PD. Third, I will use 3’UTR targeting to create a mouse model of PD in which alpha-synuclein is overexpressed, for better validation of my therapeutic strategy. Collectively, these experiments should establish proof of concept for a revolutionary, safe and effective treatment for PD.',\n",
       " 'The ILEAnet project will set up and develop a sustainable network of Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) practitioner organisations from all over Europe. The mission of this network will be to stimulate LEA capabilities to influence, develop and take up research, development and innovation (RDI) that is useful and usable for LEAs, and thereby help them to tackle the major challenges they face. The network will be organised around ILEAnet National Contacts (INCs) who will be in charge of federating the respective networks of practitioners, policy makers, academics, industrial players and other RDI stakeholders in their respective countries. ILEAnet will also operate as a community of people with a common interest in exchanging and collaborating with respect to LEA challenges and needs and LEA-centred RDI. Whilst the organisational ILEAnet Network will be focused – “top-down” - on specific challenges, the ILEAnet Community of people will contribute “bottom-up” ideas to produce innovative approaches to face newly arising challenges. \\nAn online community platform will enable professional social networking and mutual online assistance related to new solutions and best practice to address LEA challenges. The platform will support online and physical meetings and discussions, and will provide the infrastructure for efficient knowledge management. Synthesising top-down approaches and bottom-up ideas in iterative survey-organise-brainstorm-analyse-propose-discuss-poll processes, ILEAnet will build up a broad portfolio of RDI results and new RDI project concepts, and will deliver recommendations for future RDI policies. ILEAnet will hence catalyse innovation between LEAs and between LEAs, academics and industry. This will enable LEAs not only to take up mature results but also to prepare and influence future RDI efforts which could be taken up by individual or groupings of organisations and countries as well as by European research funding programmes.',\n",
       " 'Epidemiological data shows that psychiatric diagnoses in childhood have limited temporal continuity. Over the course of a child’s contact with mental health services, a diagnosis received at one time can transition into a different diagnostic classification or be lost entirely. Such shifts can have profound implications for young people and their families, given the significance invested in diagnostic labels as a means of making sense of emotional and behavioural difficulties. However, no research has investigated the prevalence of diagnostic shift in Child & Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) or explored how it is experienced by the children and families affected. PAEDS aims to provide the first such evidence through a two-stage mixed-methods design. First, a review of clinical records in an Irish CAMHS service will establish the frequency with which diagnostic shifts occur and the typical patterns through which they manifest. Second, qualitative interviews will be conducted with children and parents who have experienced diagnostic shift, to establish the narratives through which people make sense of these changes and the implications for self-concept, social identity and service engagement. To exploit the social and clinical value of the results, a Delphi process will be initiated that engages a diverse panel of stakeholders in developing evidence-based resources that help service-providers and service-users adapt to diagnostic shift. The project will thereby promote sensitive, patient-centred youth mental health policy and practice. It will also provide a platform for me to build a career pioneering the interdisciplinary study of how scientific and clinical classifications interact with identity. By fully integrating a tailored Personal Career Development Plan into the action programme, I will capitalise on the MSCA’s opportunity for the strategic development of skills and competencies valued in the current academic environment.',\n",
       " 'Proopiomelanocortin (POMC)- and Agouti-Related Peptide (AgRP)-expressing, i.e. melanocortin neurons in the hypothalamus, are key regulators of feeding behaviour, glucose metabolism, autonomic responses and higher cognitive functions. They represent targets for fuel-sensing hormones like leptin and insulin that thereby control key processes in systemic energy and glucose homeostasis. Importantly, resistance to these fuel-sensing signals is known to contribute to the current obesity and diabetes epidemic. Consequently, altered POMC- and AgRP-neuron regulation in obesity contributes to the development of numerous metabolic alterations. Although the melanocortin neurons as central regulators of metabolism have been classified according to the expression of their characteristic neuropeptides, it has only recently become clear that even within these populations they represent distinct heterogeneous neurons with respect to their physiological regulation and the biological responses governed by their specific downstream neurocircuits. However, the molecular nature of heterogeneous POMC and AgRP neuron populations, their specific neurocircuitry architecture and their specific functions still remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we will employ a wide array of state-of-the-art molecular systems neuroscience and modern mouse genetics approaches to define (1) the anatomical distribution, (2) molecular signature, (3) neurocircuitry architecture, (4) regulatory principles, (5) specific biological functions, and finally (6) novel druggable regulators of these specific POMC and AgRP microcircuits. We anticipate that the new knowledge generated will not only provide novel insights into the fundamental principles of CNS-dependent control of metabolism but could also lead to targeting these specific neurocircuits to develop novel, specific, tailor-made therapies for diverse aspects of metabolic diseases for which currently only insufficient treatment options are available.',\n",
       " 'Animals often interact in groups. Animal groups constitute complex sensory environments which challenge the brain and engage complex neural computations. This behavioral context is therefore fruitful for understanding how sophisticated neural computations give rise to behavior. However, it is also technically difficult since many of the relevant sensory cues arise from the members of the group and are therefore hard to quantify or control. Consequently, we only incompletely understand how the brain drives complex social behaviors in naturalistic contexts. To uncover the neural computations underlying social behavior in groups, we are using Drosophila, which provides unprecedented experimental access to the nervous system via genetic tools. Drosophila gathers on rotten fruit to feed and mate. Courtship and aggression dominate social interactions and rely on the recognition of sex-specific chemical cues and the production of context-specific acoustic signals. How are these multi-modal cues integrated to control and switch between courtship and aggression? How is unstable and conflicting sensory information resolved to promote stable behavioral strategies? How does sensory processing adapt to socially crowded environments in order to efficiently target behavior at individual members of the group?  These issues will be addressed by combining computational modeling and genetic tools. Using machine learning, we will quantify and model the fine structure of social interactions to identify the social cues that drive behavior. Closed-loop optogenetics and calcium imaging in behaving animals will allow us to test the models and to ultimately reveal how the brain integrates, selects and combines social cues to drive social interactions. This multi-disciplinary approach will uncover the computational principles and mechanisms by which sensory information is processed to drive behavior in the complex sensory environment of animal groups.',\n",

This project has its origins in an ex-post impact evaluation of Concern Worldwide’s twenty-five year engagement in Wolaita, Ethiopia.  Conducted by University College Dublin’s Centre for Humanitarian Action in collaboration with Wolaita Sodo University, the evaluation found that, despite significant improvements in communities’ capacities to both absorb the effects of recurring disasters and to adapt their livelihoods based on experience of recent disasters, they remain extremely vulnerable to their natural and environmental context.   As a result there is an urgent need for a novel approach that moves beyond supporting the mere absorption of or adaptation to recurring shocks and that transforms the capacity of exposed communities.  The BRTE partnership has identified the importance of education in bringing about this transformative change.  It aim is to build the capacity of Wolaita’s educational institution in pursuit of the following objectives:\\n• To build the requisite critical infrastructure  to enable resilience education and research;\\n• To establish an educational platform that will build human capital and transform livelihoods;\\n• To develop research and innovation capacity that will radically promote social and economic well-being.\\nThe BRTE programme will serve as a model of how education can drive transformative resilience in areas subject to recurring and protracted crises.',\n",

One of the main performance challenges in such scenarios is the network communications. Significant performance improvements have been achieved by using state-of-the-art methods, designed in the data management and data communication domain. However, the proposed techniques in both fields just view each other as a black box, and the additional gains in performance from a co-optimization perspective have not yet been explored. In this project, I will focus on the design and development of a novel query execution system that can bridge the gap of co-optimization between high-level query executions and low-level data communications. Such a system will be highly efficient and robust in the presence of different workloads and network configurations in large systems, and consequently deliver significant performance improvements to the large scale data-analytics community.

Attention has been directed at aggregate measures of knowledge production in regional and national contexts, but little consideration has been given to the properties of knowledge produced in specific places. How does the nature of knowledge that is produced vary over space, what conditions the scope of technologies generated in different locations, and how do these knowledge sets impact the performance of local firms and industries?\\n\\nTo date, the way in which specific regional knowledge capabilities influence the evolution of local technology trajectories and thus shape geographies of economic prosperity have not yet been considered systematically. The objective of the “Technology Evolution in Regional Economies” (TechEvo) project is to address these significant shortcomings. Focusing on the evolution of scientific and technical knowledge, as indicated by patent, trademark and scientific literature records, the point of departure is the pan-European knowledge space for all 28 European Union member countries, plus Norway and Switzerland, over the time period 1981-2015. The knowledge space, based on the co-occurrence matrix of particular knowledge domains (629), maps the proximity of patent technology classes and enables the development of regional measures of knowledge specialization for all 1,369 (NUTS3) regions. Set in an evolutionary framework the investigation provides ground breaking insights into how innovative entities and individual inventors are embedded in social and cognitive local and non-local networks, and how regional technology trajectories are shaped through entry, exit, and selection processes. TechEvo will provide a wealth of indicators, models and tools that will assist firms and policy makers in place-based investment decisions, and deliver a science and technology policy evaluation tool capable of assessing impact.',\n",

By applying a transatlantic approach to the analysis of contemporary American and European literary texts, the research component of the Action aims to renew and actualize the modes of interpretation in the field of transatlantic literary studies, to produce critically-informed readings of contemporary fiction that is responding to the crisis of transatlanticism (understood as a shared belief system), and thus to offer insight into systems of representation, the articulation of structures of power and knowledge, and how these can be re-imagined through literary fiction.

The objective is to uncover the human face of this turning point in European prehistory by directly tracing the movement of people and the spread of new social practices across cultural boundaries. Hotly debated ancient tales of migrations are tested for the first time using recent advances in genetic and isotopic methods that can measure human mobility. Combined with mortuary research, this will precisely define relations between personal mobility and status, gender, identity and health to explore social scenarios in which people moved between groups.\\nTo better understand the context of mobility, the project also evaluates social networks through which cultural traditions moved within and between distinct societies. For this purpose, regionally particular ways for making and using objects are analysed to explore how practices were exchanged and how types of objects shaped, and were shaped by, their new contexts of use. Metalwork is chosen for this research because new forms came to be widely shared across the region during the crisis, and we can employ a novel suite of analytic methods that explore how this material exposes wider social changes.\\nAs personal and cultural mobility took place in social landscapes, the changing strategies for controlling access and mobility in settlement organisation are next explored. The character and causes of conflicts arising through these diverse venues for interaction are identified and we assess if they were catalysts for, or consequences of, unstable social systems.\\nTHE FALL uses new primary research to test how this interplay between local developments, cultural transmissions and movement of people shaped the processes and events leading to the collapse of these early complex societies',\n",
       " 'HD is a monogentic disease, meaning modification in a single gene occurring in all cells of the body. In Western countries it is estimated that 5-7 people per 100,000 are affected by HD. Currently there is no cure for the disease and effective management is key to quality of life for those who are affected. Patients and families who are living with the disease face multiple social and self-management issues. For example, stigma of the disease alongside social isolation have been key drivers in terms of high levels of mental health difficulties. CH has the ability to assist with many of the difficulties faced by HD, RD and indeed other symptom related diseases. For example, CH can monitor and identify key intervention points along the disease progression pathway, it can inform and facilitate integrated care, it can assist with joining key stakeholders together in a shared ecosystem, and importantly it can assist patients and their families in terms of reducing isolation, optimising self-management and thus increasing empowerment and self-actualisation. Further, CH has the ability to optimise scarce resources in an over stretched health care system and thus produce effective and efficient outcomes.\\nThe primary aim of this RISE project is to establish an international and inter-sectoral network of organisations working in collaboration on a research project which seeks to design a technology enabled patient centred care pathway which will identify how to optimise Connected Health (CH) interventions at key points along Huntington’s Disease (HD) trajectory. \\nThis is an important project because patient centred care from a CH perspective in the area of HD is currently under developed.

The aim of INTE-AFRICA is to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of large-scale scale up. Research evidence needed by African health services to scale-up and sustain the screening and management of diabetes and hypertension in different settings will be generated.  The objectives include: to re-organise primary health care services so that diabetes and hypertension can be diagnosed and treated in dedicated chronic care clinics in two large regions, one in Tanzania and in Uganda; to decentralise care from health facilities to the community in order to reduce patient load at clinics and reduce reliance on (scarce) clinical staff; to evaluate these approaches in terms of acceptability (by patients and the community), numbers of patients treated and retained in care, patient clinical outcomes (blood pressure control, blood glucose control), costs of delivering integrated care for the health service and cost-effectiveness (compared to current standard care); to use the data generated to contribute evidence to the development of clinical guidelines; to develop the sustainable partnerships needed between researchers, government policy makers, public-private partnerships on an ethos of openness and equality so as to facilitate the expansion of the scale-up nationally.

       " 'The Internet-of-Things (IoT) will soon represent the main target application of ICs, involving thousands of autonomous devices forming a large communication network for the purpose of exchanging/processing information about the physical world. From a hardware standpoint, the RF wireless transceivers of IoT devices demand the highest possible energy efficiency and a small area to enable inexpensive large-scale integration. Since analog/RF building blocks must be integrated with the mainstream digital technology, new circuit topologies and techniques must be adopted. The time-mode signaling, recently exploited in all-digital PLLs, data converters (the so called time-mode or VCO-based ADCs), opamps and filters, allows the performance of “analog” circuits to improve with the technology scaling. The proposed research focuses on a novel architecture of time-mode ADC, attempting to mitigate the fundamental limitations of such class of converters (i.e. the highly nonlinear VCO) by exploiting advanced RF techniques, thus giving rise to a hybrid time/frequency-mode operation. Studies have shown that by injection-locking an oscillator to its own delayed resonating waveform (self-injection-locking, SIL), the oscillating frequency can be made reasonably linear versus only two well-controlled parameters (i.e. the amplitude and phase of the self-injected signal). The SIL technique will be exploited to achieve a known, predictable relationship between the oscillating frequency and a certain analog quantity (i.e. the input signal). Accordingly, the proposed research attempts to mathematically overcome, and not to compensate accordingly, the nonlinear characteristic of an oscillator. By adding a simple digital frequency detector, SILICON has potential to devise a new class of data converters, the SIL-ADCs. It will also provide the applicant with cutting edge training from academic & industry leaders in the field which will be implemented using a personalised career development plan.',\n",

       " \"In recent decades, Regional Trade Agreements (RTA) have become increasingly prevalent. A common way of assessing costs and benefits of RTAs is by using Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) approach. CGE based studies then use this framework to forecast for example, the trade growth, job creation, and welfare gains from forming RTAs. Unfortunately, their predictions poorly match the  actual medium to long run outcomes of existing RTAs.  With RTAs such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnerships (TTIP) currently under negotiation, CGE analysis plays a central role in the negotiation process. Therefore the accuracy of CGE models is of paramount importance. One way in which modern CGE models fall short is in their overly simplistic approach to trade costs. This includes both their measurement and their place in the underlying model. In particular, CGE studies to date fail to account for within-country trade costs, i.e. trade costs which are non-discriminatory as they apply to both domestic and foreign firms. Instead, they focus solely on discriminatory trade costs which apply only to foreigners. This has critical implications both in how to measure trade costs (as many compare within-country to cross-border trade and therefore combine discriminatory and non-discriminatory trade costs) and in how to include them in the analysis. As the goal of RTAs is to reduce trade barriers, this oversight can result in incorrect expectations on an RTA's impact and therefore  wrong policy recommendations. The aim of COST project is to develop trade cost measures and specifications for modelling impacts of trade costs for CGE models that overcome these methodological and modelling limitations and consequently improve accuracy of future CGE studies in predicting the costs and benefits of RTAs.\",\n",

This project addresses one particular human rights assumption - that the standardization of memory enforced through memorialization policies is effective and necessary in promoting human rights values. Human rights advocates insist on memorialization as a crucial step in establishing moral responsibility for past atrocities understanding it as an insurance policy against the repetition of crimes. In nationalist ideologies, however, memory and memorialization is used for the sake of defining the “self” and the “other” through boundaries along ethnic lines. The project investigates the ways in which human rights advocates understand, promote and mandate supposedly universal memorialization standards, asking whether in so doing they weaken or instead often actually strengthen nationalism.

       " '‘Almost three centuries later, it is past time to rethink Montesquieu’s holy trinity’ (Ackerman, 2010).\\n\\nAs Ackerman (and many others) have observed, political reality has long left the traditional model of the separation of powers behind. The problems posed by this gap between constitutional theory and political practice have recently acquired fresh urgency as developments in Hungary, Poland, Turkey, Russia, the UK, US, Bolivia and elsewhere place the separation of powers under strain. These include the emergence of authoritarian leaders; personalisation of political authority; recourse to non-legal plebiscites; and the capture or de-legitimisation of other constitutional bodies. \\n\\nThis project argues that these difficulties are rooted in a deeper problem with constitutional thinking about institutional power: a constitution-as-law approach that equates the conferral of legal power with the authority to exercise it. This makes it possible for a gap to emerge between legal accounts of authority and its diverse –and potentially conflicting (Cotterrell)– sociological foundations. Where that gap exists, the practical authority of an institution (or constitution) may be vulnerable to challenge from rival and more socially-resonant claims (Scheppele (2017)). \\n\\nIt is this gap between legal norms and social facts that the project aims to investigate – and ultimately bridge. \\n\\nHow is authority established? How is it maintained? How might it fail? And how does the constitution (as rule? representation (Saward)? mission statement (King)?) shape, re-shape and come to be shaped by those processes? By investigating these questions across six case studies, the project will produce a multi-dimensional account of institutional authority that takes seriously the sociological influence of both law and culture.\\n\\nThe results from these cases provide the evidential foundation for the project’s final outputs: a new model and new evaluative measures of the separation of powers.',\n",

       " \"Over the past 25 years deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite its success, the mechanisms of DBS are not yet fully understood. Moreover, patients experience side effects and poor control of symptoms associated with suboptimal programming of stimulus parameters.  Current DBS systems operate in an 'open-loop' configuration with stimulus parameters (pulse amplitude, duration and frequency) empirically set and remaining fixed over time. Closed-loop DBS offers an alternative approach that has the potential to overcome current limitations and increase therapeutic efficacy, while reducing side-effects and increasing battery life, by automatically adjusting stimulation parameters as required. Although the potential benefits of closed-loop DBS are widely recognised, these systems have not yet been implemented clinically. Under the parent ERC project DBSmodel, we have developed biophysically detailed computational models of the neural circuits in the brain during DBS and are using these to develop and test novel algorithms for closed-loop DBS.  Before these can be trialled in humans, however, feasibility must first to be demonstrated through implementation on a prototype device and pre-clinical testing in animal models. ERC proof of concept funding will enable us to do this by implementing and testing a novel closed-loop DBS system in an animal model of PD. The experimental validation will confirm the efficacy of a prototype solution suitable for translation to human studies.\",\n",
       " 'Dr. Eoin O’Cearbhaill, a Biomedical Engineer, recently returned to Ireland to become a Lecturer in Bioengineering at University College Dublin. This fellowship will enable him to work with Prof. Michael Gilchrist to develop his career by implementing a research platform based on medical devices for therapeutic delivery, with a specific focus on microneedles. Microneedle transdermal patches are an important advance in the delivery of therapeutics, especially vaccines and biotech molecules. They offer advantages over the classic approaches of hypodermic drug delivery, (needle phobia, risk of needle stick injuries), oral delivery (degradation and poor intestinal permeability of biologics), and traditional skin patches (limited to passive delivery of small molecules). The traditional hollow needle design suffers from a scaling effect, limiting mechanical performance at the penetration depth required for efficient absorption and large molecule delivery. Current microneedle patches targeting transdermal delivery are often prohibitively expensive to manufacture and are prone to mechanical failure. Here, Dr. O’Cearbhaill proposes the development of microneedle patches with interconnected porosity, aimed at consistent, rapid delivery to dermal tissue, in close proximity to the capillary bed. This platform technology can also be applied to other minimally invasive devices designed to provide controlled therapeutic infusion to precise locations. The applicant will develop porous microdevices, using manufacturing techniques that are scalable and cost-effective, enhancing the commercial value and potential to rapidly translate this technology to patients. The reintegrating applicant’s proficiency in medical device concept development will synergise with the host’s expertise in computational modelling of penetration in soft tissue and micromanufacturing to aid in the applicant’s development as a leader in medical device design and innovation.',\n",
       " 'The proposed research will provide a deeper understanding of the internal structure of the nucleon by studying ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) of protons and ions using data collected by the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The structure will be probed by measuring the cross sections of (i) time-like Compton scattering, (ii) exclusive diffractive production of J/ψ mesons, (iii) pairs of mesons containing charm or bottom quarks and (iv) dijet production in proton-lead UPCs. The first two processes probe gluon and quark generalized parton distributions, which describe the  distribution of quarks and gluons inside the nucleon or heavy ion as a function of their longitudinal momentum fraction and their transverse position. The last two processes offer access to Wigner distributions, which in addition are sensitive to transverse momentum. The processes are also sensitive to saturation phenomena.',\n",
       " 'REMOURBAN aims at the development and validation in three lighthouse cities (Valladolid-Spain, Nottingham-UK and Tepebasi/Eskisehir-Turkey) of a sustainable urban regeneration model that leverages the convergence area of the energy, mobility and ICT sectors in order to accelerate the deployment of innovative technologies, organisational and economic solutions to significantly increase resource and energy efficiency, improve the sustainability of urban transport and drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas. The urban renovation strategy will be focused on the citizens, because they become the cornerstones to making a smart city a reality and will not only be the most affected by the improvements but also they will be the common factor of each of them.\\n\\nHOW THE OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACHIEVED \\n1. Developing a sustainable urban regeneration model, considering a holistic approach, which supports the decision making of the main stakeholders for addressing wide renovation and city transformation processes.\\n2. Validating the urban regeneration model by means of large scale interventions on several cities called lighthouse cities, Valladolid, Nottingham and Tepebasi/Eskisehir (more than 1.000 dwellings retrofitted, more than 190 EV deployed and a total investment higher than 14 M€).\\n3. Guaranteeing the replicability of the model at European level. Two cities will be also involved in the consortium, called follower cities, Seraing (Belgium) and Miskolc (Hungary) and will be developed a procedure for assessing the replicability potential of the model.\\n4. It is planned an intense activity focused on generating exploitation and market deployment strategies to support the commercial exploitation of the project outcomes.\\n5. It will be deployed a powerful communication and dissemination plan. This plan will integrate a citizen engagement strategy and will disseminate the benefits of the project to a wide variety of audiences (more than 11.000 citizens engaged).',\n",
       " 'In modern digital societies, mobile networks provide connectivity that is crucial for the operation of all other critical infrastructures such as energy, transport etc. Thus, a disruption in the telecommunication infrastructure will lead to severe social and economic consequences. These disruptions often have unpredictable causes such as cyber-attacks, natural catastrophes, technical and human errors. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen mobile networks against both cyber and physical threats. Responding to these threats has been identified as a priority by the EU. Future 5th-Generation (5G) mobile networks will be designed using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and network virtualization principles to transform rigid and disparate legacy mobile networks into scalable and dynamic ecosystems. In large-scale SDN networks such as mobile networks, multiple SDN controllers are used to control different network segments. Inter-Controller Communication (ICC) between these multiple SDN controllers is necessary to share control information and to perform important network management functions. If ICC is compromised, then the whole system will be compromised regardless of what happens in the rest of the network. Inevitably, 5G ICC is also vulnerable to a wide range of cyber and physical threats. Since, the exsisting SDN security systems cannot provide a sufficient level of security for 5G ICC against both cyber and physical threats, the RESPONSE-5G project will be the first research project to implement and validate a robust and secure Multi-Controller Communication Platform for 5G Networks which includes prevention and mitigation against both cyber and physical attacks. RESPONSE-5G has far-reaching potential impacts in the domains of 5G security. Through this fellowship and the planned secondments, the candidate will gain advanced research skills and develop abilities in technology transfer and industry engagement, in order to fully exploit these impacts.',\n",
       " 'Applications of rank-metric codes arise ever more frequently in network communications problems, and yet their mathematical theory is still in its infancy. To date attention has almost exclusively focussed on very special classes of codes and their generalizations. \\n\\nThe covering problem for rank-metric codes is largely unsolved, and is an important combinatorial research topic. For error-free paradigms, codes with low covering radius  provide efficient solutions for broadcast problems, and specifically to optimizing content delivery networks for large files distribution. Current approaches to such applications are suboptimal, while known methods to obtaining best possible performance are computationally infeasible. For error-correcting schemes, the covering radius is an important indicator of code performance, as it measures the number of errors that can be corrected in network transmissions.\\n\\nWe propose to develop a mathematical theory of covering codes for the rank metric. We will obtain bounds on the covering radius of an arbitrary rank-metric code, as well as special classes of codes. We will develop the fundamental tools required to pioneer this theory, offering scope for researchers of Algebraic Coding Theory, as well as combinatorial objects useful for Engineering applications. We will also investigate symmetric rank-metric codes, focussing on their distance distributions. These codes have a very rich combinatorial structure.\\n\\nThe combined expertise of the Applied Algebra group at UCD, along with the methods developed by the applicant in his PhD, will propel the project to achieve its objectives. The potential scientific impact is high, given the newness and combinatorial hardness of the topic, its importance for network communications, and exponentially increasing data traffic. The impact for the applicant will be the opportunity to establish this fundamental topic, magnify his scientific profile, and consolidate/expand his professional network.',\n",
       " 'University students  continue to develop their physics identity by engaging in practices that are central to the physics community. However, many  students also participate in other relevant practices, such as teaching and outreach. For some, teaching and outreach may be integral to their experience doing physics and building identity, although that may be counter to messaging from advisors or academia about their value. In this work, we investigate university students negotiation of physics identity after they have volunteered in informal physics programs for primary school children. We hypothesize that university students’ physics identity is foster or reshaped by the interactions and experiences they have in the program. We analyze university students interviews and responses to pre and post surveys using a blended framework of Self-Determination Theory and Community of Practice frameworks. From this analysis, we extract the experiences that affect their physics identity as they negotiate their memberships in the informal and formal physics communities of practice.',\n",
       " \"What can the large scale literary datasets now available tell us about the ways in which national cultures develop and the role of migration in that development? This project seeks to push beyond the frontiers of current understanding of the role of migration and migrants in the dynamics of cultural change and continuity, examining intra-European migration in the Victorian period through the ‘macroscope' of text mining and the microscopes of literary scholarship. During the Victorian period Britain was the target destination for large numbers of migrants from across Europe fleeing war, political turmoil and/or economic deprivation. While this period and process has attracted considerable attention from historians, literary studies have primarily focussed on colonial racist and imperialist attitudes or representations of single ethnic groups. VICTEUR will focus on how the intra-European cultural exchange triggered by this movement of population is embedded in Victorian fiction. It will  identify persistent and residual narratives and attitudes to a cross-section of European migrants by members of the host community and the cultural output of these migrants across a very large literary data set, the 35,918 volumes of fiction in the British Library Nineteenth Century Corpus operationalised for text mining via UCD’s Curatr data interface. VICTEUR will trace the residual impact of these cultural representations in  neo-Victorian fiction, film and television, focussing on the period 2011-2016, combining methodologies from text mining, transmedia and cultural memory studies. The project will examine in detail the relationship between gender and national and ethnic identities within the texts and the impact of authorial gender on representations of migrants by British and migrant writers. It will develop a new transhistorical and intra-national model for understanding migration as a key driver of cultural development at the interface of gender, ethnicity and demography.\",\n",
       " 'CO-CREATE aims to reduce childhood obesity and its co-morbidities by working with adolescents, to create, inform and disseminate obesity-preventive evidence-based policies. The project applies a systems approach to provide a better understanding of how factors associated with obesity interact at various levels. The project focus on adolescence as the specific target group, a crucial age with increasing autonomy and the next generation of adults, parents and policymakers, and thus important agents for change. CO-CREATE involve and empower adolescents and youth organizations to foster a participatory process of identifying and formulating relevant policies, deliberating such options with other private and public actors, promoting relevant policy agenda and tools and strategies for implementation. CO-CREATE strengthen interdisciplinary research and have an inclusive multi-actor approach with involvement of academics, policy makers, civil society, relevant industry and market actors to ensure long-lasting implementation of the results. The project reflects and builds on a number of existing initiatives and platforms, including the extensive research activity from consortium members. The project has a strong gender profile and consider the relevance of geographic, socio-economic, behaviour and cultural factors. CO-CREATE engages international partners from different policy-contexts in Europe, Australia, South Africa and the US.  Applying large-scale datasets, policy monitoring tools, novel analytical approaches and youth involvement will provide new efficient strategies, tools and programmes for promoting sustainable and healthy dietary behaviours and lifestyles. The generated knowledge and innovative tools for assessing actual policy implementation, strategies for empowering adolescents; and strategies for identifying, implementing and monitoring relevant policy programmes are applicable to stakeholders involved in the European efforts to tackle childhood obesity.',\n",
       " 'Trade unions play a major role in democratic interest intermediation. This role is currently threatened by the increasingly authoritarian strain in EU’s new economic governance (NEG). This project aims to explore the challenges and possibilities that the NEG poses to labour politics. Until recently, European labour politics has mainly been shaped by horizontal market integration through the free movement of goods, capital, services and people. After the financial crisis, the latter has been complemented by vertical integration effected through the direct surveillance of member states. The resulting NEG opens contradictory possibilities for labour movements in Europe.\\nOn the one hand, the reliance of the NEG on vertical surveillance makes decisions taken in its name more tangible, offering concrete targets for contentious transnational collective action. On the other hand however, the NEG mimics the governance structures of multinational firms, by using key performance indicators that put countries in competition with one another. This constitutes a deterrent to transnational collective action. The NEG’s interventionist and competitive strains also pose the threat of nationalist counter-movements, thus making European collective action ever more vital for the future of EU integration and democracy.\\nThis project has the following objectives:\\n1. To understand the interrelation between NEG and existing ‘horizontal’ EU economic governance; and the shifts in labour politics triggered by NEG;\\n2. To open up novel analytical approaches that are able to capture both national and transnational social processes at work; \\n3. To analyse the responses of established trade unions and new social movements to NEG in selected subject areas and economic sectors at national and EU levels, and their feedback effects on NEG;\\n4. To develop a new scientific paradigm capable of accounting for the interplay between EU economic governance, labour politics and EU democracy.',\n",
       " 'Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a relentlessly progressive, lethal, lung disease with a uniquely poor prognosis. Patients typically die within 2-5years of diagnosis and IPF’s European incidence is increasing while effective therapies for improving survival remain elusive.\\n\\nIPF is a disease in which the normal wound healing responses are dysregulated leading to fibrosis and loss of gas-exchange regions in the lung rather than restoration of normal lung structure and function. Recently discovered invasive fibroblasts are believed to be central to the progressive fibrogenesis observed in IPF by contributing to an accumulation of fibroblasts in the injured lung and augmenting the destruction of normal alveolar structure. However the source of these invasive fibroblasts and what makes them so uniquely pathogenic is unknown.\\n\\nOn this project I will work with Prof. Paul Noble, Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre, USA, one of the world’s leading IPF researchers and Ireland’s leading respiratory researcher Prof. Paul McLoughlin, University College Dublin, Ireland. The objectives of this project are to investigate: (1) the phenotype and behaviour of the invasive fibroblast from human IPF donors in vitro; (2) delineate the molecular pathways that make invasive human IPF fibroblasts uniquely pathogenic using state-of-the-art single cell RNA-sequencing; (3) determine the source of invasive fibroblast accumulation in the IPF lung using the most advanced lineage tracing methods available in a cutting-edge genetically modified mouse model.\\n\\nThis interdisciplinary proposal will merge skills I have acquired with the latest technologies across multiple disciplines in world leading international institutions to explore the complex molecular basis of IPF. The results of this proposal will generate significant impact in the IPF field and will be directly applicable to the specific challenge highlighted in the H2020 Work Programme: Diagnostic characterisation of rare diseases.',\n",
